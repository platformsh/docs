Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

What is the difference between a Platform, a Project and an Environment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Platform is the infrastructure which is running all your projects.

A project is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple environments.

An environment is a standalone copy of your live site (the Master environment) which can be used for testing, implementing new features...

Do you support MySQL?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Platform.sh <https://platform.sh>`_ uses MariaDB to manage and store your databases. It's a fork of MySQL which is more stable and has more interesting features.

Do you support other database services?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We'll soon support PostgreSQL. We aim to support all the most popular database services like MongoDB...

Does cloning an environment duplicate services?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes ! Branching an environment creates an exact copy (snapshot) of the parent environment, containing the files, the database, the services...

Why do I see "File not found"?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see the "File not found" when accessing your site within a browser, this means that you’ve pushed your code as a vanilla project but no *index.php* has been found.

Make sure your repository contains an *index.php* file as the root, or that your make files are properly named.

What happens if I push a local branch to my project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you push a local branch that you created with Git, you create what we call an :term:`inactive environment`, ie. an environment that is not deployed.

This means there won't be any services attached to this branch.

You are able to convert an :term:`inactive environment` into an :term:`active environment` and vice versa back from the environment configuration page.

How do I use Solr with Platform.sh?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::
    This should go somewhere to the **services** section.

ssh into your env and do: cat /etc/hosts (is there solr there?)

How does Master scale?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Master get all the resources that are divided into each service (PHP 40%, MySQL 30%, Redis 10%, Solr 20%…). Each Development environment get the Development plan resources.

What exactly am I sshing into?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're logged in to the PHP service. It's a read-only file system.

Can I edit a quick fix on a Platform environment without triggering a rebuild?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No ! Since the PHP service you access via SSH is a read-only file system, you'll have to push your fix to be able to test it.

What do I see when I push code?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We try to make the log as self-explanatory as possible, so you should see the Git output and also output from the drush make...

You can also find it back by clicking on the status of the activity in the :term:`Platform UI`.

What Linux distribution is Platform using?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Platform is built on Debian.

Glossary
--------

In the :ref:`glossary-label` you can find explained terminology.

If I choose the Development plan, can I use that plan for production?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Development plan provides all the tools to build your website. You can create as many development profiles as you wish for yourself and for your team.
Once your project is built and ready for production, you can choose another plan to go live. These plans are listed on the `pricing page <https://platform.sh/pricing/>`_.

Why did you choose the .sh extension for your domain?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

'sh' is the short version of shell.

According to Wikipedia™, in computing, a `shell <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>`_ is a `user interface <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface>`_ for access to an operating system's services. Generally, operating system shells use either a `command-line interface <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface>`_ (CLI) or `graphical user interface <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface>`_ (GUI).
This is exactly what Platform.sh is about: Giving developers tools to build, test, deploy, and run great websites!

Which geographic zones is Platform covering?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Platform leverages the powerful AWS Infrastructure.
We can deploy your site in a `data center <https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/globalinfrastructure/regional-product-services/>`_ that is very close to your target audience.

Which IP will my environment use to access external service?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All non-enterprise Platform clusters all reach the outside through a limited number of IP addresses.

European cluster (eu.platform.sh):

* 54.72.94.105
* 54.76.137.67
* 54.76.137.94

American cluster (us.platform.sh):

* 54.88.149.31
* 54.209.114.37
* 54.210.53.51

Those are stable, but, for obvious reasons, we cannot commit that they will be there forever. If we need to change them, however, we will give ample prior notice.
