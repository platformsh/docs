Technical Requirements
======================

`Platform.sh <https://platform.sh/>`_ will require you to have **Git** installed. You also need to be familiar with **SSH**.

.. _git:

Git
---

Git is the open source version control system that is utilized by Platform.sh. 

Any change you make to your Platform.sh project will need to be committed via Git. You can see all the Git commit messages of an :ref:`environment <environments>` in the activity feed of :ref:`ui_overview`.

Before getting started, make sure you have it installed on your computer to be able to interact with Platform.sh.

.. _ssh:

SSH
---

One of the ways `Platform.sh <https://platform.sh/>`_ keeps things secure is by using :ref:`SSH` behind the scenes. Users connect to their Platform.sh :ref:`git` repository and to their :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` using SSH. 

SSH requires two `RSA keys <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>`_:

* A **private key** kept secret by the user
* A **public key** stored within the Platform.sh account. 

These keys are called the *public-private keypair* and usually look like random lines of characters, like this. 

*A private key*: ::

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

*A public key (one very long line)*: ::

You will need a :ref:`ssh` *public/private keypair* in order to interact with Platform.sh. Your public key is upladed to your Platform.sh user account, and it then governs authentication for  :ref:`git`, SSH sessions (shell access), and other tools that connect to your Platform.sh project.
