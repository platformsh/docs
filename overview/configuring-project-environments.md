#Configuring your Project

There are two levels to the configuration of your Platform.sh project:

1. One touches the configuration for everything that is global to the same project - the applications and services that make your project
2. The other touches each different environment  for this project (so your live production environment is one, a testing environment, or a development environment would be others)

You can con configure many aspects of Platform.sh through the web interface and
through the CLI. 

But some configuration must be done through configuration files (and most importantly the
basic configuration of your application and services).
