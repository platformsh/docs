#Discover Platform.sh

Platform.sh is a managed and automated high-availability hosting platform for
PHP.

>The developer pushes code, and we automatically put everything into production.

We support any PHP application, but worked hard to get the developer experience 
for Drupal and Symfony totally awesome.

## No System Administration Required

We deploy databases and configure the lot with no sysadmin work: None, zero..
Itâ€™s fully automated and happens almost instantly. Platform.sh cuts out the
middle-man between your code and deployment.

## Automatic Staging Management
Our job is to make developers' lives easier, and to practically eliminate all
sysadmin chores. We can create staging and development environments on-the-fly
that are precise copies of production with even the same data as production.
And we can do so in 30 seconds.

## Batteries Included
* Every Platform.sh plan includes 4 environments (one for the live/production environment, 3 for staging/development). You can have as many Inactive Environments as you wish. You can pay to have as many Active ones as you'd like.
* You can add fully managed backend services, like MySQL, Postgres, Solr, Elastic Search, Redis etc.. without requiring external add-ons.
* You can use a robust build process (with support for not only composer, but also NodeJS, Ruby and Python scripts).
* You can upsize production plans to more memory and cpu to handle larger traffic.
* You can opt for our Enterprise offering giving you white-glove support and 99.99% guaranteed availability.

## Great integrations
Platform.sh comes out-of-the-box with great integrations for services such
as Bitbucket, Github, Hipchat and Blackfire and generic Webhooks allow you 
to create your own integrations with your internal tooling with little effort.

## Documentation

The [User Guide](../user_guide/) will give you detailed technical information
about how Platform.sh operates, how to configure every aspect of it, use
multiple applications in the same project, configure and use search engines and
caches or integrate with external services such as GitHub, Bitbucket or
Blackfire.
