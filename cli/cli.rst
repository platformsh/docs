.. _cli:

What is the CLI?
----------------

The :ref:`cli` is the official tool to use and manage your Platform.sh projects directly from your terminal. Anything you can do in the :ref:`ui_overview` can be done with the :ref:`cli`.

How do I get it?
----------------

You can install the :ref:`cli` easily using Composer:

.. code-block:: console

  composer global require platformsh/cli:@stable

You can find the system requirements and more information in the `installation instructions on GitHub <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/blob/master/README.md>`_.

.. seealso::
  * :ref:`install_cli`

What can I do with the CLI?
---------------------------

The :ref:`cli` uses the :ref:`platform_api` to trigger commands (*Branch, Merge...*) on your Platform.sh project.

It's also very useful when you work locally since it can simulate a local build of your codebase as if you were pushing a change to Platform.sh.

Once you have the :ref:`cli` installed, run ``platform list`` to see all of the available commands.

.. code-block:: console

  $ platform list
  Platform.sh CLI

  Global options:
    --help           -h Display this help message
