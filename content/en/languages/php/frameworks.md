## Drupal

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is an open-source content management framework written in PHP. Since Composer comes pre-installed on Platform.sh, Drupal can be installed and updated completely using Composer. The default [build flavor](/overview/build-deploy.md#building-the-application) for PHP application runs `composer install` during build, handling all of your dependencies automatically.
