# Java Featured Frameworks

## Hibernate

[Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
