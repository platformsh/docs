1. **Install the CLI**

    In your terminal run the following command depending on your operating system:

    * **Installing on OSX or Linux**

       ```bash
       curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
       ```

    * **Installing on Windows**

       ```bash
       curl https://platform.sh/cli/installer -o cli-installer.php
       php cli-installer.php
       ```

2. **Authenticate and Verify**

   Once the installation has completed, you can run the CLI in your terminal with the command

   ```bash
   platform
   ```

   Take a moment to view some of the available commands with the command

   ```bash
   platform list
   ```

Now that you have installed the CLI and it is communicating with Platform.sh, you can configure and push your project to Platform.sh.
