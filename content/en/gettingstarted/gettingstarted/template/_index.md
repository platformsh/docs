  Welcome to Platform.sh! Getting started is as easy as opening a <a href="https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup">free trial account</a> and initializing a <a href="/development/templates.html">template project</a>.<br><br>

  There are no requirements on your part at this point. This guide will take you from zero to hero - from first glance to a deployed application entirely from your browser.
