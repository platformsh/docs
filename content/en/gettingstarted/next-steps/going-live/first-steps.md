# Going live

## Preliminary Steps

Before you take your site live, there are a few steps that will help you prepare the project.

1. **Register your domain and choose a suitable DNS provider**

    If you plan on serving exclusively from a subdomain such as the historically common `www.` subdomain, you will be able use any DNS provider that supports CNAME records. If you wish to use the apex domain, eg. `https://site.com`, with no `www.` subdomain, choose one of the specialized DNS providers that allow you to use [ALIAS or ANAME records](/golive/steps/dns.md). Make sure to do this before moving on to the next steps, as the CLI will reject attempts to add domains that do not allow CNAMEs.

2. **Test your routes**

    Test your application and make sure that all of your routes are functioning as you intended. Consult the [routes]() documentation as well to verify that your `routes.yaml` has been properly written.

    If any [access restrictions](/administration/web/configure-environment.md#http-access-control) have been enabled during development, be sure to remove them as well.

3. **(Optional) Obtain 3rd party SSL if needed**

    Let's Encrypt SSL certificates are automatically issued for Platform.sh projects at no charge to you. If you instead would like to use a [3rd party SSL certificate](/golive/steps/tls.md), make sure that you have purchased it and that it is active prior to going live.

    Additionally, if your application uses [wildcard routes](/golive/steps/tls.md), it will require custom certificates for them, as Let's Encrypt does not support wildcard certificates.

After you have gone through the following checklist your application is ready to be taken live!
