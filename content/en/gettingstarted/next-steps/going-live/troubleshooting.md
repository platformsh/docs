# Going live

## Done!

Now your application has been taken live!

As mentioned before, it may take a little time for the DNS to fully propagate, depending on the registrar. Otherwise, your domain should now point to the `master` production environment of your project.

### Additional information

If through the following steps your project did not successfully configure to your domain, you can consult the Troubleshooting guide here:

* [Going Live: Troubleshooting](/golive/troubleshoot.md)

Consider using the Fastly CDN for increased performance and more control over caching:

Consider using Cloudflare's TLS/SSL service to secure your site via HTTPS when using a CDN:
