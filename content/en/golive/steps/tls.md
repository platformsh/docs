description: "Platform.sh automatically provides standard TLS certificates issued by <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let's Encrypt</a> to all production instances. No further action is required to use TLS-encrypted connections beyond <a href=\"/configuration/routes.html#HTTPS\">specifying HTTPS routes</a> in your <code>routes.yaml</code> file.<br><br>Alternatively, you may provide your own third party TLS certificate from the TLS issuer of your choice at no charge from us.  Please consult your TLS issuer for instructions on how to generate an TLS certificate.<br><br>A custom certificate is not necessary for development environments.  Platform.sh automatically provides wildcard certificates that cover all *.platform.sh domains, including development environments."

### Adding a custom certificate through the management console

You can add a custom certificate via the Platform.sh [management console](/administration/web.md). In the management console for the project go to [Settings](/administration/web/configure-project.md) and click Certificates on the left hand side. You can add a certificate with the `Add` button at the top of the page. You can then add your private key, public key certificate and optional certificate chain.

### Adding a custom certificate through the CLI

Example:
```bash
platform domain:add secure.example.com --cert=/etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.crt --key=/etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.key
```

See `platform help domain:add` for more information.
