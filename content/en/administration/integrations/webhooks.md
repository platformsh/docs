  This hook allows you to capture any push events on platform and POST a JSON message describing the activity to the url of your choice. You can use this to further automate your Platform.sh workflow.
---

{{< description >}}

## Setup

```bash
platform integration:add --type=webhook --url=A-URL-THAT-CAN-RECEIVE-THE-POSTED-JSON
```

The webhook URL will receive a POST message for every "Activity" that is triggered, and the message will contain complete information about the entire state of the project at that time.  In practice most of the message can be ignored but is available if needed.  The most commonly used values are documented below.

It's also possible to set the integration to only send certain activity types, or only activities on certain branches.  The CLI will prompt you to specify which to include or exclude.  Leave at the default values to get all events on all environments in a project.

## Webhook schema

### `id`

A unique opaque value to identify the activity.

### `project`

The Project ID for which the activity was triggered.  Use this value if you want to have multiple projects POST to the same URL.

### `type`

The `type` property specifies the event that happened.  Its value is one of:


* `project.modify.title`: The human-friendly title of the project has been changed.
* `project.create`: A project has been created.  Although it will appear in the activity feed exactly once, it will not be sent via a webhook as it will always happen before a webhook can be configured.
* `project.domain.create`: A new domain has been added to the project.
* `project.domain.delete`: A domain associated with the project has been removed.
* `project.domain.update`: A domain associated with the project has been updated, including modifying it's SSL certificate.
---
* `environment.access.add`: A new user has been given access to the environment.
* `environment.access.remove`: A user has been removed from the environment.
---
* `environment.backup`: A user triggered a [backup](/administration/backup-and-restore.md)
* `environment.restore`: A user restored a [backup](/administration/backup-and-restore.md)
---
* `environment.push`: A user has pushed code to a branch, either existing or new.
* `environment.branch`: A new branch has been created via the management console. (A branch created via a push will show up only as an `environment.push`.)
* `environment.activate`: A branch has been "activated", and an environment created for it.
* `environment.initialize`: The master branch of the project has just been initialized with its first commit.
* `environment.deactivate`: A branch has been "deactivated". The code is still there but the environment was destroyed.
* `environment.synchronize`: An environment has had its data and/or code re-copied from its parent environment.
* `environment.merge`: A branch was merged through the management console or Platform.sh API. A basic Git merge will not trigger this event.
* `environment.delete`: A branch was deleted.
---
* `environment.route.create`: A new route has been created through the management console. This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
* `environment.route.delete`: A route has been deleted through the management console. This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
* `environment.route.update`: A route has been modified through the management console. This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
---
* `environment.variable.create`: A new variable has been created.
* `environment.variable.delete`: A variable has been deleted.
* `environment.variable.update`: A variable has been modified.
---
* `environment.update.http_access`: HTTP access rules for an environment have been modified.
* `environment.update.smtp`: Sending of emails has been enabled/disabled for an environment.
* `environment.update.restrict_robots`: The block-all-robots feature has been enabled/disabled.
* `environment.subscription.update`: The master environment has been resized because the subscription has changed.  There are no content changes.

### `environments`

An array listing the environments that were involved in the activity. This is usually single-value.

### `result`

Whether the activity was completed successfully or not. It should be `success` if all went as planned.

### `created_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`

These values are all timestamps in UTC.  If you need only a point in time when the action happened, use `completed_at`.  You can also combine it with `started_at` to see how long the activity took.

### `log`

A text description of the action that happened.  This is a human-friendly string that may be displayed to a user but should not be parsed for data as its structure is not guaranteed.

### `payload.environment`

This block contains information about the environment itself, after the action has taken place.  The most notable properties of this key are

* `name` (the name of the branch)
* `machine_name` (the name of the environment)
* `head_commit` (the Git commit ID that triggered the event)

### `payload.user`

The Platform.sh user that triggered the activity.

### `deployment`

This large block details all information about all services in the environment.  That includes the resulting configuration objects derived from [`routes.yaml`](/configuration/routes.md), [`services.yaml`](/configuration/services.md), and [`.platform.app.yaml`](/configuration/app-containers.md).

Most notably, the `deployment.routes` object's keys are all of the URLs made available by the environment.  Note that some will be redirects.  To find those that are live URLs filter to those objects whose `type` property is `upstream`.


## Example webhook payload

The following is an example of a webhook message.  Specifically, this one was created by a "push" event.

## Validate the integration

You can then verify that your integration is functioning properly [using the CLI](/administration/integrations.md#validating-integrations) command

```bash
platform integration:validate
```
