Customizing settings.php
========================

Platform.sh allows you to use your own ``settings.php`` that you commit to your Git repository.

If you do so, make sure you include a ``settings.local.php`` file which will be generated by Platform.sh on each of your environments.

Here is a default ``settings.php``:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  $update_free_access = FALSE;

  $local_settings = dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.local.php';
  if (file_exists($local_settings)) {
    require_once($local_settings);
  }

Any ``settings*.php`` file will be copied. It means you can use ``settings.dev.php`` and ``settings.staging.php``, then include the right one depending on environment variables.

For example, you can load a development file for any development environment, by providing the ``drupal:load_development_overrides`` environment variable, and adding this code at the end of the ``settings.php``:

.. code-block:: php-code

   if (!empty($conf['load_development_overrides'])) {
     require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.dev.php';
   }

It means the ``settings.dev.php`` file must exist in your repository root folder.

.. note::
  The ``drupal:*`` environment variables are included in the ``settings.local.php`` file, so include it first.

.. note::
  The ``settings.local.php`` file will always be overwritten by Platform.sh.

.. note::
  You also need to add a custom ``$drupal_hash_salt``.

Shared variables
----------------

You can use your custom ``settings.php`` to define configuration that is shared among all your environments.

For example, you can extract the ``PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` variable to get the configuration of all services deployed on your environment. Since the ``PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` is JSON encoded, you'll need to decode it before using it.

Here is an example to define the Redis configuration:

.. code-block:: php

  // Platform redis connection info.
  if (!empty($_SERVER['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS'])) {
    $relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($_SERVER['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']));
    if (!empty($relationships->redis)) {
      $conf['redis_client_host'] = $relationships->redis[0]->host;
      $conf['redis_client_port'] = $relationships->redis[0]->port;
    }
  }
