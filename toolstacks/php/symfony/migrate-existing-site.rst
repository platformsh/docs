Migrate an existing site to Platform.sh
=======================================

To migrate your existing site into Platform.sh, here are the three components you need to import: *code base*, *database* and *files*.

Import your code base
---------------------

This will depend wether you have Git already set up for your project or not.

Your project already uses Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're already working with Git for your project, then you simply need to add a **platform** remote repository. In that case, you will keep your existing Git history.

On a terminal, go to your Git project folder and add **platform** as a remote.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~/Sites/platform
   $ git remote add platform [PROJECT-ID]@git.[REGION].platform.sh:[PROJECT-ID].git

.. note:: You can copy-paste the Git URL from the Platform UI under the Git icon.

Then push your local branch to your **platform** remote.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git push platform HEAD:master

Both on the terminal and on the Platform UI, you should see your :term:`Master` environment being built.

Your project doesn't use Git yet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're not working with Git for your project, then you'll need to initialize your repo.

On a terminal, go to your project folder, initiate the Git repository, and add a **platform** remote repository.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~/Sites/mysite
   $ git init
   $ git remote add platform [PROJECT-ID]@git.[REGION].platform.sh:[PROJECT-ID].git

.. note:: You can get the Git URL from the Platform UI under the Git icon.

Commit your project to the **platform** remote repository and push the code.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Initial commit of My Site"
   $ git push platform master

.. note:: 
   *git init* should have created a default *master* branch for you locally, so you can directly push that branch to you *master* remote branch on Platform.sh.

Both on the terminal and on the :ref:`ui_overview`, you should see your :term:`Master` environment being built.

Import your database
--------------------

Export your database in an SQL file or in a compressed file.

Copy it via SSH to the remote environment on Platform into the ``/app/tmp`` folder which is writable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ scp database.sql [PROJECT-ID]-master@ssh.[REGION].platform.sh:/app/tmp

Log in to the environment via SSH and import the database:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh [PROJECT-ID]-master@ssh.[REGION].platform.sh
   web@[PROJECT-ID]-master--php:~$ mysql -h database.internal main < tmp/database.sql

Import your files
-----------------

Go to your files folder on your local machine and synchronize them to your remote Platform.sh environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ rsync -r files/. [PROJECT-ID]-master@ssh.[REGION].platform.sh:/app/tmp/

.. note::
   The location of the files folder depends on your configuration.
