# Type

The `type` key defines the base container image that will be used to run the application.  There is a separate base container image for each primary language for the application, often in multiple versions.  Supported languages include:

* [`php`](/languages/php.md)
* [`hhvm`](/languages/php.md)
* [`nodejs`](/languages/nodejs.md)
* [`python`](/languages/python.md)
* [`ruby`](/languages/ruby.md)
* [`golang`](/languages/go.md)

See the appropriate language page for all available versions.

**Example**

```yaml
type: php:7.1
```

## Runtime

The `.platform.app.yaml` file also supports a `runtime` key that allows selected customizations to the language runtime. As those possibilities vary by language, please see the appropriate language documentation.

* [PHP](/languages/php.md)
