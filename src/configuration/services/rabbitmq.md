# RabbitMQ (Message Queue service)

RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

See the [RabbitMQ documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html) for more information.

## Supported versions

* 3.5

## Relationship

The format exposed in the ``$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` [environment variable](/development/variables.md):

```json
{
   "rabbitmq" : [
      {
         "password" : "guest",
         "ip" : "246.0.129.2",
         "scheme" : "amqp",
         "port" : 5672,
         "host" : "rabbitmq.internal",
         "username" : "guest"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Usage example

In your ``.platform/services.yaml``:

```yaml
myrabbitmq:
    type: rabbitmq:3.5
    disk: 1024
```

In your ``.platform.app.yaml``:

```yaml
relationships:
    mq: "myrabbitmq:rabbitmq"
```

You can then use the service in a configuration file of your application with something like:

```php
<?php
$relationships = getenv("PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS");
if (!$relationships) {
  return;
}

$relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($relationships), TRUE);

foreach ($relationships['mq'] as $endpoint) {
  $container->setParameter('rabbitmq_host', $endpoint['host']);
  $container->setParameter('rabbitmq_port', $endpoint['port']);
}
```

# Connecting to RabbitMQ

## From your local development environment

For debugging purposes, it's sometimes useful to be able to directly connect to
a service instance. You can do this using SSH tunneling. To open a tunnel, log
into your application container like usual, but with an extra flag to enable
local port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 5672:mq.internal:5672 <projectid>-<branch_ID>@ssh.eu.platform.sh
```

Within that SSH session, use the following command to pretty-print your
relationships. This lets you see which username and password to use, and you
can double check that the remote service's port is 5672.

```bash
php -r 'print_r(json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV["PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS"])));'
```

If your service is running on a different port, you can re-open your SSH
session with the correct port by modifying your `-L` flag: `-L
5672:mq.internal:<remote port>`.

Finally, while the session is open, you can launch a RabbitMQ client of your
choice from your local workstation, configured to connect to localhost:5672
using the username and password you found in the relationship variable.

## From the application container

The application container currently doesn't include any useful utilities to
connect to RabbitMQ with. However, you can work around this by adding a client
as a dependency in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.

For example, you can use
[amqp-utils](https://github.com/dougbarth/amqp-utils/) by adding this:
 ```yaml
dependencies:
  ruby:
    amqp-utils: "0.5.1"
```

Then, when you SSH into your container, you can simply type any ``amqp-``
command available to manage your queues.

## From your PHP application

The PHP container that is deployed doesn't ship with the
[AMQP](https://pecl.php.net/package/amqp) PHP extension yet, so consider
including a pure PHP library (like
[PHP AMQPlib](https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib)) in your source tree
instead.
