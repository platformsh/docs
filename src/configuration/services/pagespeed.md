# PageSpeed Service (beta)

The PageSpeed service speeds up your site and reduces page load time by automatically applying web performance best practices to pages and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring you to modify your existing content or workflow. It is based on the Open Source PageSpeed project by Google. See the [PageSpeed docs](https://developers.google.com/speed/).

This service is very much fire-and-forget and does not currently allow for any configuration. It is also currently experimental. So your mileage may vary.

## Supported versions

* 1.12

## Setup

To describe the relationship between Pagespeed and your application, you need to set up an endpoint and a relationship to your application. Both will carry the same name, `<relationship to app>` in the services.yaml example.

Example of a `.platform/services.yaml`, where you need to fill `<relationship to your app>` and `<name of your app>` with your own:

```yaml
pagespeed:
    type: pagespeed:1.12
    configuration:
        endpoints:
            <relationship to your app>: {}
    relationships:
        <relationship to your app>: "<name of your app>:http"
```

This is basically a proxy service that sits between our router (the web server) and your application. It exposes an end-point (here confusingly named `app`) and has a relationship to the application also called app.

Usually in your Â `.platform/routes.yaml` you would have an `upstream` composed of the name of the application (the one you put in `.platform.app.yaml` and the protocol (currently always `http`). To use the PageSpeed service we make the router use it as its upstream rather than directly the app. In this example: `pagespeed:http-<relationship to your app>` instead of `app:http`. 

```yaml
https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "pagespeed:http-<relationship to your app>"
    cache:
        enabled: false
```
