# Elasticsearch (Search Service)

Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud.

See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) for more information.

## Supported versions

* 0.90
* 1.4
* 1.7

## Relationship

The format exposed in the `$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](/development/variables.md):

```json
{
    "elasticsearch": [
        {
            "host": "248.0.65.198",
            "scheme": "http",
            "port": "9200"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage example

In your `.platform/services.yaml`:

```yaml
mysearch:
    type: elasticsearch:1.4
    disk: 1024
```

In your `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml
relationships:
    elasticsearch: "mysearch:elasticsearch"
```

You can then use the service in a configuration file of your application with something like:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS'])) {
  $relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']), TRUE);

  foreach ($relationships['elasticsearch'] as $endpoint) {
    $container->setParameter('elasticsearch_host', $endpoint['host']);
    $container->setParameter('elasticsearch_port', $endpoint['port']);
  }
}
```
