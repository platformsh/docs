# Getting started

## Prerequisites

**Composer**

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will install them in your project for you.

> -   [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Configure your app

The ideal `.platform.app.yaml` file will vary from project project, and you are free to customize yours as needed.  A recommended baseline Symfony configuration is listed below, and can also be found in our [Symfony template project](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-symfony).
