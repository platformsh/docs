You may cancel your plan at any time and you will only be billed for the actual period used.

For Enterprise and Agency Plans you can pay by purchase order. For all other plans you need to add a credit card to your account.

We offer a free trial period so you can test the service and see how great it is. If ever you need more time to evaluate Platform.sh, please contact our sales representatives. They can issue you an extra voucher to prolong your test.

> Prices below are listed in US Dollars.  You will be billed in US Dollars, Euros, or British Pounds depending on where your billing address is.

> Euro Prices are presented excluding VAT.  In your bill, as appropriate we will include the correct VAT rate.

## Extras

All extra consumption is prorated to the time it was actually used.

> For example, if you added an extra developer for 10 days you would be billed around $3 extra at the end of the month.

### Extra developers

Adding a developer to your project will add $10 per month.

### Extra environments

You can add extra staging/development environments to any plan by multiples of 3 for $21 / month.

> For example, if you want to have 12 staging environments you would pay additional $63 per month on top of your basic plan price.

### Extra storage

You can add additional storage at $2.50 per 5GB  per staging/development environment.

>For example, if you have the default plan (with 3 staging environments) and you add 10GB (for a total of 15GB per environment), you would pay an extra $15 a month.

>If you added 3 extra environments (for a total of 6 staging environments) and you added 10GB (for a total of 15GB per environment), you would pay an extra $30 a month.

## Development

The basic plan (Development) starts at $10 per month, and includes 4 environments: 3 staging/development and 1 future production).

> You can not map a custom domain name to a development plan

Development environments have less resources than production environments.

## Production - Standard / Medium / Large / Extra Large / Double Extra Large
 

The live environment (master) of a production plan has more resources than the development environments of the project.

You can map domain names to your master environment. SSL support is always included.

Production plans come in five flavors:

* Standard: with 2GB of dedicated memory
* Medium: with 4GB of dedicated memory
* Large: with 6GB of dedicated memory
* Extra Large: with 12GB of dedicated memory
* Double Extra Large: with 24GB of dedicated memory

### Multiple Applications in a single project

All Platform.sh plans support multiple applications in a single cluster, but they share the global resources of the cluster.

The resources of a **Standard plan are not sufficient to run more than one application** in the same cluster if there is also a MySQL database as a Service. Useful multi-apps start at Medium.

A Medium plan, for example, can support 3 Apps with a MySQL instance and a Redis instance.
A Double Extra Large plan, for example, can support 40 micro-services with a MySQL instance and a Redis and a RabbitMQ running in the cluster, or it can simply run huge application containers to support high transactional traffic.

If you wonder if a specific setup would fit in a plan, don't hesitate to contact our support.

## Enterprise

Enterprise plans start at around $1000 a month. Enterprise clusters can scale to hundreds of CPUs and Terabytes of RAM.

For a price lower than traditional managed hosting, you get included development and staging environments, as well as triple redundancy on every element of the stack with:

> 99.99% Uptime Guaranteed

## Sovereign German Cloud and Australian Region


The prices for Germany and Australia are currently set at 30% above the EU and US plan prices. Thus, a "Production Standard" environment on the Sovereign German Cloud will be $65 instead of $50.

Our estimation page (which you can reach by clicking on your account dashboard on the edit link for a project) does reflect these new options.
