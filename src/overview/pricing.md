* One Developer License
* 5GB of Storage per environment
* Multiple Backend services (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, Redis, Solr..)
* Support

You can switch between plans (downgrade or upgrade) freely but note that
reducing storage is currently not supported for technical reasons. If you need
to reduce storage please create a support ticket. You will always be billed the
prorated rate of your plan over the period it was used.

You may cancel your plan at any time and you will only be billed for the actual
period used.

For Enterprise and Agency Plans you can pay by Purchase Order, for all other
plans you need to add a Credit Card to your account.

We offer a free trial period so you can test the service and see how great they
are. If ever you need more time to evaluate Platform.sh please contact our
sales representatives they can issue you an extra voucher to prolong your
test.

> In this section we describe the billing in US Dollars, you will be billed in
> Dollars, Euros or British Pounds depending on where your billing address is.

> Euro Prices are presented excluding VAT, in your bill, as appropriate we will
> include the correct VAT rate.

## Extras

All extra consumption is prorated to the time it was actually used.

> So if for example you added an extra developer for 10 days you would be billed around  extra $3 at the end of the month.

### Extra developers

Adding a developer to your project will add $10 per month.

### Extra environments

You can add extra development staging/development to any plan by multiples of 3
for $21 / month.

> So if for example you want to have 12 staging servers you would pay additional $63 per month on top of your basic plan price.

### Extra storage

You can add additional storage at $2.50 per 5GB  per staging/development
environment.

>So if you have the default plan (with 3 staging environments) and you add 10GB (so total 15GB per environment) you would pay an extra $15 a month.

>If you added 3 extra environments (for a total of 6 staging environments) and you added 10GB (so total 15GB) you would pay an extra $30 a month.

## Development

The basic Plan (development) starts at 10$ per month (including 4 environments : 3 staging/development and 1 future production).

> You can not map a custom domain name to a development plan

Development environments have less resources than production environments.

## Production - Standard / Medium / Large

The live environment (master) of a production plan has more resources
then the development environments of the project.

You can map domain names to your master environment. SSL support is always
included.

Production plans come in three flavors:

* Standard: with 2GB of dedicated memory
* Medium: with 4GB of dedicated memory
* Large: with 7GB of dedicated memory

### Multiple Applications in a single project
All Platform.sh plans support multiple applications in a single cluster but
they all share the global resource of the cluster.

The resources of a **Standard plan are not sufficient to run more then one
application** in the same cluster if there is also a MySQL database as a service. So useful multi-apps start at Medium.

A Medium plan for example can support 3 Apps with a MySql Instance and a Redis
instance.

If you wonder if a specific setup would fit in a plan, don't hesitate to
contact our support.

## Enterprise

Enterprise plans start at $815 a month.

So for a price lower than traditional managed hosting, you get included
development and staging environments and triple redundancy on every element of
the stack.

> With 99.99% Uptime Guaranteed
> And 24/7 White Glove On-boarding and Support
