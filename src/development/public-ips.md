# Public IP addresses

## Outbound IP addresses

Platform.sh regions reach the outside through a limited number of IP
addresses.

European region (eu.platform.sh):

-   54.72.94.105
-   54.76.137.67
-   54.76.137.94

North American region (us.platform.sh):

-   54.88.149.31
-   54.209.114.37
-   54.210.53.51

These IP addresses are stable, but not guaranteed to never change. Prior to
any future change, all affected customers will receive ample warning.

you can add our IP addresses for inbound traffic below to your whitelist.
