# Accessing logs

Logs for various tasks on an application container are available in the `/var/log` directory.  They can be accessed on the normal shell after loging in with `platform ssh`.  Alternatively, they may also be accessed remotely using the `platform log` command.  The CLI lets you specify which log file to access (the name of the file below minus the `.log` extension), as well as view the entire file in a pager, only the most recent lines, and so forth.  Run `platform log --help` for complete documentation.

A number of different log files are available depending on the application container in use.

Although the `/var/log` directory is writeable, it should not be written to directly. Only write to it via standard logging mechanisms, such as your application's logging facility.

## `access.log`

This is the raw access log for the nginx instance running on the application container. That is, it does not include any requests that return a redirect or cache hit from the [router](configuration/routes.md).

## `app.log`

Any log messages generated by the application will be sent to this file.  That includes language errors such as PHP Errors, Warnings, and Notices, as well as uncaught exceptions.

## `cron.log`

The cron log contains the output of all recent cron executions.  If there is no cron hook specified in the container configuration then this file will be absent. It also will not exist until the first time cron has run.

## `deploy.log`

The deploy log contains the output of the most recent run of the deploy hook for the container.  If there is no deploy hook then this file will be absent.

## `nginx/error.log`

nginx startup log messages will be recorded in this file.  It is rarely needed except when debugging possible nginx configuration errors. This file is not currently available using the `platform log` command.

## `error.log`

nginx-level errors that occur once nginx has fully started will be recorded here. This will include HTTP 500 errors for missing directories, file types that are excluded based on the `.platform.app.yaml` file, etc.

## `php.access.log`

On a PHP container, the php.access.log contains a record of all requests to the PHP service.
