# Node.js

Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  Platform.sh supports deploying Node.js applications quickly and easily. Using our Multi-App support you can build a micro-service oriented system mixing both Javascript and PHP applications.

## Supported versions

<div id = "nodejsSupported"></div>

<script>
makeImagesList("runtimes", "nodejs", "supported", "nodejsSupported");
</script>

If you need other versions, take a look at our [options for installing them with NVM](/languages/nodejs/nvm.html).

### Deprecated versions

The following versions are available but are not receiving security updates from upstream, so their use is not recommended. They will be removed at some point in the future.

<div id = "nodejsDeprecated"></div>

<script>
makeImagesList("runtimes", "nodejs", "deprecated", "nodejsDeprecated");
</script>

## Support libraries

While it is possible to read the environment directly from your application, it is generally easier and more robust to use the [`platformsh-config`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs) NPM library which handles decoding of service credential information for you.

## Configuration

To use Platform.sh and Node.js together, configure the ``.platform.app.yaml`` file with a few key settings, as described here (a complete example is included at the end).

1. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):

   ```yaml
   # .platform.app.yaml
   type: "nodejs:10"
   ```

2. Specify your dependencies under the `nodejs` key, like this:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     nodejs:
       pm2: "^2.5.0"
   ```

   These are the global dependencies of your project (the ones you would have installed with `npm install -g`). Here we specify the `pm2` process manager that will allow us to run the node process.

3. Configure the command you use to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section, e.g.:

   ```yaml
   web:
     commands:
       start: template
   ```

   If there is a package.json file present at the root of your repository, Platform.sh will automatically install the dependencies. We suggest including the `platformsh-config` helper npm module, which makes it trivial to access the running environment.

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "platformsh-config": "^2.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Create any Read/Write mounts. The root file system is read only. You must explicitly describe writable mounts. In (3) we set the home of the process manager to `/app/run` so this needs to be writable.

   ```yaml
   mounts:
       run:
           source: local
           source_path: run
   ```

5. Include any relevant commands needed to build and setup your application in the `hooks` section, e.g.:

   ```yaml
   hooks:
     build: |
       npm install
       npm run build
       bower install
   ```

6. Setup the routes to your nodejs application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.

  ```yaml
  "https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "app:http"
  ```

Here's a complete example that also serves static assets (.png from the `/public` directory):

```yaml
name: node
type: nodejs:10

web:
  commands:
    start: "PM2_HOME=/app/run pm2 start index.js --no-daemon"
    #in this setup you will find your application stdout and stderr in /app/run/logs
  locations:
    "/public":
      passthru: false
      root: "public"
      # Whether to allow files not matching a rule or not.
      allow: true
      rules:
        '\.png$':
          allow: true
          expires: -1
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    pm2: "^2.5.0"
mounts:
   run:
       source: local
       source_path: run
disk: 512
```

## In your application...

Finally, make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen over the port given by the environment (here we use the platformsh helper and get it from config.port) that is available in the environment variable ``PORT``.  Here's an example:

```js
// Load the http module to create an http server.
const http = require('http');

// Load the Platform.sh configuration
const config= require('platformsh-config').config();

const server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.end("<html><head><title>Hello Node.js</title></head><body><h1><img src='public/js.png'>Hello Node.js</h1><h3>Platform configuration:</h3><pre>"+JSON.stringify(config, null, 4) + "</pre></body></html>");
});

server.listen(config.port);
```

## Accessing services

To access various [services](/configuration/services.md) with Node.js, see the following examples.  The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.

## Project templates

A number of project templates for Node.js applications and typical configurations are available on GitHub. Not all of them are proactively maintained but all can be used as a starting point or reference for building your own website or web application.

<div>
    <table id="nodeTemplate" border="1">
    <tbody></tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<script>
makeTemplateTable("nodejs", "nodeTemplate");
</script>
