# User administration

##User roles

Every Platform.sh user has a role which controls access and improves
security on your project. Different roles are authorized to do
different things with your applications, environments and users. You can
use your collection of Roles to manage how users interact with
Platform.sh.

At the project level:

-   **Project Administrator** - A project administrator can change
    settings and execute actions on any environment.
-   **Project Reader** - A project reader can view all environments
    within a project but cannot execute any actions on them.

A Project Reader can have a specific role on different environments. At
the environment level:

-   **Environment Administrator** - An environment administrator can
    change settings and execute actions on this environment.
-   **Environment Contributor** - An environment contributor can push
    code to this environment. He or she can also branch the environment.
-   **Environment Reader** - An environment reader can only view this
    environment.

> **Important!**
> After a new user is added to an environment, it needs to be rebuilt. Rebuilds
> are triggered when you push a new commit to the environment in question.
> To be able to rebuild without new code changes you can issue the command
> `git commit --allow-empty -m'rebuild' && git push`
> to create an empty commit and "force" rebuilding the environment.
>
> When the environment rebuild is complete, allow a minute for the routes to
> update fully and for the new user to be able to use SSH access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a development team works on a project, the team leader can be the
project administrator and decide which roles to give his team members.
One team member can contribute to one environment, another member can
administer a different environment and the customer can be a reader of
the `master` environment.

If you want your users to be able to see everything (Reader), but only
commit to a specific branch, change their permission level on that
environment to "Contributor".

> **Important!**
> An environment contributor can push code to the environment but that user
> role does not have SSH access to the environment.** by default only
> environment Administrators have SSH access**. You can change the default
> in `.platform.app.yaml` by example by specifying `ssh: contributor`

> **note**
> The project owner - the person licensed to use Platform.sh - doesn't have
> special powers. A project owner usually has a project administrator role.

## Manage user permissions at the project level

Access the project-level configuration.

![Project configure icon](/images/project_w-configarrow.png)

Click the project configuration icon next to the project name in the
upper-left corner of the project page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manage users.

![Project user management screenshot](/images/project_usermanagement.png)

The `Access control` tab shows project-level users and their roles.

Selecting a user will allow you either to edit that user's permissions
or delete the user's access to the project entirely.

Add a new user by clicking on the `Add user` button.

If you select the 'Reader' role for the user, you'll have the option
of adjusting the user's permissions at the environment level.

Once this has been done, if the user does not have a Platform.sh account, they
will receive an email asking to confirm their details and register an account
name and a password.

In order to push and pull code (or to SSH to one of the project's environments)
the user will need to add an SSH key.

If the user already has an account, they will receive an email with a link to
the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Manage user permissions at the environment level

Access the environment-level configuration.

![Project configure icon](/images/environment_w-configarrow.png)

Click the environment configuration icon next to the environment name
on the project page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Project user management screenshot](/images/environment_usermanagement.png)

The `User Management` tab shows environment-level users and their
roles.

Selecting a user will allow you either to edit that user's permissions
or delete the user's access to the environment entirely.

Add a new user by clicking on the `Add user` button.

> **note**
> Remember the user will only be able to access the environment once it has
> been rebuilt (after a `git push`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Manage user with the CLI
You can user the Platform.sh command line client to fully manage your users
and integrate this with any other automated system.

Available commands:

* user:add
  * Add a user to the project
* user:delete
  * Delete a user
* user:list (users)
  * List project users
* user:role
  * View or change a user's role

For example, the following command would add the 'admin' role to alice@example.com
in the current project.

```
   platform user:add
```

This will present you with an interactive wizard that will allow you to choose
precisely what rights you want to give the new user.

```bash
$ platform user:add

Email address: alice@example.com
The user's project role can be 'viewer' ('v') or 'admin' ('a').
Project role [V/a]:
The user's environment-level roles can be 'viewer', 'contributor', or 'admin'.
development environment role [V/c/a]:
sprint1 environment role [V/c/a]:
hot-fix environment role [V/c/a]:
master environment role [V/c/a]:
pr-2 environment role [V/c/a]:
pr-3 environment role [V/c/a]:
Summary:
    Email address: alice@example.com
    Project role: viewer
    development: viewer
    sprint1: viewer
    hot-fix: viewer
    pr-2: viewer
    pr-3: viewer
Adding users can result in additional charges.
Are you sure you want to add this user? [Y/n]
User alice@example.com created
```

Once this has been done, the user will receive an email asking her to confirm
her details and register an account name and a password.

To give Alice the 'contributor' role on the environment 'development', you could run:

```
   platform user:role alice@example.com --level environment --environment development --role contributor
```

Use `platform list` to get the full list of commands.

## Transfer ownership

If you want to transfer ownership of your project to a different user,
first invite this user as a project administrator and then submit a
support ticket to ask for the ownership transfer.

This action will automatically transfer the subscription charges to the
new owner.
