# The relationships block defines how services are mapped within your application.
relationships:
    # At this time Platform.sh does not support circular relationships between services or
    # applications, which  means you cannot add a relationship in your .platform.app.yaml that
    # points to the Varnish service. If you do so then one of the relationships will be
    # skipped and the connection will not work. This limitation may be lifted in the future. See
    # https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services/varnish.html#circular-relationships for
    # more information.
    # The Varnish service does offer an 'http+stats' endpoint, which provides
    # access and debugging tools that can be defined as a relationship.
    varnishstats: "varnish:http+stats"
    # You can then access the 'varnishstats' relationship over HTTP. Consule the Varnish
    # documentation (https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services/varnish.html#stats-endpoint) to see
    # the full list of paths provided by the 'http+stats' endpoint.
    # Note that because of the circular relationship issue noted above this cannot be done on the application
    # that Varnish is forwarding to. It will need to be run on a separate application container.
