# Network Storage allows you to define a file store that can be shared between different application containers.
# The service enables a new kind of 'mount' that refers to a shared service rather than to a local directory.
# At this time, Network Storage is available on all regions except 'eu.platform.sh' and 'us.platform.sh'.
# After you have declared the service files in your 'services.yaml' file, add an entry
# to your mounts list for it. Platform.sh is read-only by default after the build process is completed, and defining mounts
# is the only way to set aside writable disk on a deployed application. Consult the mounts documentation
# (https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/storage.html#mounts) for more details.
# Note that you do not need to add a relationship to point to the files service. That is handled automatically by the system.
mounts:
     # Declare the writable mount path 'my/files' on the application container.
    'my/files':
        # The source for the mount is defined as the service 'files' rather than a local directory.
        source: service
        service: files
        # The source_path specifies the path within the network service that the mount points to. It is
        # often easiest to have it match the name of the mount point itself but that is not required.
        source_path: files
