# Introduction

Platform.sh is a second-generation Platform-as-a-Service built especially for continuous deployment. It allows you to host web applications on the cloud while making your development and testing workflows more productive.

If you're new to Platform.sh, we recommend starting with the **Big Picture**, in particular [Basics](/overview/basics.md), [Structure](/overview/structure.md), and [How it works](/overview/how-it-works.md) will get you started on the right track to best leverage Platform.sh.

The main requirement of Platform.sh is that you use Git to manage your application code. Your project's configuration is driven almost entirely by a small number of YAML files in your Git repository.  The **Configuration** section covers those in more detail and can serve as both tutorial and quick-reference.

Platform.sh supports a number of different programming **Languages** and environments, and features recommended optimizations for a number of **Featured Frameworks**.

Finally, you can also get tips for setting up your own **Development** workflow, and **Administering** your Platform.sh account.
