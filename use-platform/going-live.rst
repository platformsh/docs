Going Live
==========

Here are the steps you need to follow when your site is ready to go live.

.. _domains:

1 - Domains
-----------

First step is to add your domain.

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`Manage domains via the web UI <ui_project_domains>`

You can add multiple domains to point to your project. Each domain can have its own SSL certificate.

After you have added your domain, your Master environment will no longer be accessible at ``master-<project_id>.<cluster>.platform.sh``.

If you require access to the site, you can create a hosts file entry and point it to the IP address that resolves when you access your master project branch.

2 - Routes
----------

You can configure the :term:`routes` of your project directly within the :ref:`ui_overview` or within your ``.platform/routes.yaml`` file.

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`routes_configuration`

Single hostname
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want your site to only be available at ``http://mydomain.com`` and have ``http://www.mydomain.com`` redirect to ``http://mydomain.com``, you need define your ``routes.yaml`` as follow:

.. code-block:: console

    "http://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "php:php"

    "http://www.{default}/":
        type: redirect
        to: "http://{default}/"

Multiple hostnames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want your site to be available at both ``http://mydomain.com`` and ``http://www.mydomain.com``, you need to define one upstream for each hostname.

Here would be an example of your ``routes.yaml`` for the ``http://mydomain.com`` URL:

.. code-block:: console

    "http://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "php:php"

    "http://www.{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "php:php"

.. note::
  You can test those routes on your development environments with:

  * ``http://[branch]]-[project-id].[region].platform.sh``
  * ``http://www-[branch]]-[project-id].[region].platform.sh``

.. _https:

HTTPS
^^^^^

If you have uploaded your SSL certificate and you want to serve your entire site with HTTPS, here is what your routes would look like:

.. code-block:: console

    "https://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "php:php"

    "http://{default}/":
        type: redirect
        to: "https://{default}/"

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`routes_configuration`

.. _dns:

3 - DNS
-------

Configure your DNS provider to point your domain to your `Platform.sh <https://platform.sh>`_  Master environment.

Once you've checked with your registrar about where to change your DNS settings, add a CNAME record that references the Master environment's hostname: ``<environment>-<project>.<region>.platform.sh``

If you use multiple hostnames for your site, you need to add a CNAME record for each of them. For example: ``master-k4ywtmwigmmgc.eu.platform.sh`` and ``www-master-k4ywtmwigmmgc.eu.platform.sh``.

Note: This will **not** work for an apex (or "naked") domain. In that case, you need to use a DNS provider that supports forwarding DNS queries (such as the `CNAME with ALIAS record from Dyn <http://dyn.com/support/record-types-standard-dns/>`_, or the ANAME record on `DNS Made Easy <http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/services/aname-records/>`_). Many other providers also work arounds to accomplish this goal. The most common is to add a CNAME record for the ``www`` host on the domain and then use the DNS provider's redirection service to redirect the apex over to the ``www`` version of the domain. Check with your DNS provider to see how they support this.


Naked domain (sans www)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The www portion of your domain is a subdomain. In fact, any part of your domain that precedes domain.tld can be called a subdomain, not just “obvious” subdomains like shop.domain.tld.

One of the challenges of using a cloud hosting service like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud (EC2) is that you need to point your DNS to a CNAME. The problem is the DNS RFC (RFC1033) requires the "zone apex" (sometimes called the "root domain" or "naked domain") to be an "A Record," not a CNAME. This means that with most DNS providers you can setup a subdomain CNAME to point to EC2, but you cannot setup your root domain as a CNAME to point to EC2.

In other words, with most DNS providers:

+------------------+--------------------+------+-------------------------------+
| you can do this  | ``www.domain.tld`` |CNAME |``some.host.name.platform.sh`` |                                  
+------------------+--------------------+------+-------------------------------+
| you can't do this| ``domain.tld``     |CNAME |``some.host.name.platform.sh`` |                                
+------------------+--------------------+------+-------------------------------+

You also cannot reliably point your root A Record to an IP address within the cloud providers network since they reserve the right to reallocate the IP address dedicated to your instance.

Some DNS hosts provide a way to get CNAME-like functionality at the zone apex using a custom record type. Such records include:

* ALIAS at `Route53 <http://aws.amazon.com/route53>`_
* CNAME at `Namechep <http://www.namecheap.com/>`_
* ALIAS at `DNSimple <https://dnsimple.com/>`_
* ANAME at `DNS Made <Easy http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/>`_
* ANAME at `easyDNS <https://www.easydns.com/>`_
* ACNAME at `CloudFlare <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`_
* ALIAS at `PointDNS <https://pointhq.com/>`_

These ALIAS/CNAME/ANAME records resolves on request the IP address of the destination record and serves it as if it would be the IP address for the apex domain requested. If the IP address for the destination changes, the IP address for the mapped domain changes automatically as well.


4 - SSL/TLS
-----------

* Generate private key

* Use openssl to generate a new private key

* Generate CSR

* Submit CSR to SSL provider

* Subdomain

* Root domain

* Testing SSL

* Add / change certificate


General SSL Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staging, and other development environments can use a wildcard certificate provided by Platform.sh.

Purchasing an SSL cert varies in cost and process depending on the vendor. Using SSL providers will require some or all of the following steps:

Generate private key
Before requesting an SSL cert, you need to generate a private key in your local environment using the openssl tool. If you aren’t able to execute the openssl command from the terminal you may need to install it.

Mac OS X

Homebrew: brew install openssl

Windows

`Windows executable <http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html>`_

Ubuntu Linux

apt-get install openssl

Use openssl to generate a new private key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When prompted, enter an easy password value as it will only be used when generating the CSR and not by your app at runtime.

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.pass.key 2048
...
Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:

The private key needs to be stripped of its password so it can be loaded without manually entering the password.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key

You now have a server.key private key file in your current working directory.

Generate CSR
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A CSR is a certificate signing request and is also required when purchasing an SSL cert. Using the private key from the previous step, generate the CSR. This will require you to enter identifying information about your organization and domain.

Though most fields are self-explanatory, pay close attention to the following:

Country Name
The two letter code, in ISO 3166-1 format, of the country in which your organization is based.

Common Name
This is the fully qualified domain name that you wish to secure.
For a single subdomain: www.example.com
For all subdomains, specify the wildcard URL: \*\.example.com
For the root domain: example.com

The Common Name field must match the secure domain. You cannot purchase a certificate for the root domain, e.g.,example.com, and expect to secure www.example.com. The inverse is also true. Each domain can have one certificate and it can be attached to the main domain or subdomain.


Generate the CSR:

.. code-block:: console

  $ openssl req -nodes -new -key server.key -out server.csr
  ...
  Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
  Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:www.example.com
  ...

The result of this operation will be a server.csr file in your local directory (alongside the server.key private key file from the previous step).

Submit CSR to SSL provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, begin the process of creating a new SSL certificate with your chosen certificate provider. This will vary depending on your provider, but at some point you will need to upload the CSR generated in the previous step.

You may also be asked for what web server to create the certificate. If so, select Nginx as the web server for use on Platform.sh. If Nginx is not an option, Apache 2.x will also suffice.

If you’re given an option of what certificate format to use (PKCS, X.509 etc…) choose X.509.

If you want to secure more than one subdomain you will need to purchase a wildcard certificate from your provider. While these certificates are typically more expensive, they allow you to serve requests for all subdomains of \*\.example.com over SSL.

On completion of the SSL certificate purchase process you should have several files including:
The SSL certificate for the domain specified in your CSR, downloaded from your certificate provider. This file will have either a.pem or .crt extension.
The private key you generated in the first step, server.key.


Once you have the SSL certificate file and private key you are ready to configure SSL Endpoint for your app. First, provision an endpoint.

Use the Platform.sh CLI to add the certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

  platform domain:add [--project[="..."]] [--cert="..."] [--key="..."] [--chain="..."] [name]

  platform help domain:add

  Usage:
  domain:add [--project[="..."]] [--cert="..."] [--key="..."] [--chain="..."] [name]

  Arguments:
  name                  The name of the domain

  Options:
  --project             The project ID
  --cert                The path to the certificate file for this domain.
  --key                 The path to the private key file for the provided certificate.
  --chain               The path to the certificate chain file or files for the provided certificate. (multiple values allowed)
  --help (-h)           Display this help message.
  --quiet (-q)          Do not output any message.
  --verbose (-v|vv|vvv) Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
  --version (-V)        Display this application version.
  --yes (-y)            Answer "yes" to all prompts.
  --no (-n)             Answer "no" to all prompts.
  --shell (-s)          Launch the shell.

Subdomain
^^^^^^^^^

If you’re securing a subdomain, e.g., www.example.com, modify your DNS settings and create a CNAME record to the endpoint or modify the CNAME target if you already have a CNAME record.

Record	Name	Target

CNAME	www	<ENVIRONMENT>-<PROJECT-ID>.<REGION>.platform.sh.

If you’re using a wildcard certificate your DNS setup will look similar.

Record	Name	Target

CNAME	*	<ENVIRONMENT>-<PROJECT-ID>.<REGION>.platform.sh.

Root domain
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you’re securing a root domain, e.g., example.com, you must be using a DNS provider that provides CNAME-like functionality at the zone apex.

Modify your DNS settings and create an ALIAS or ANAME record to the endpoint.

Record	Name	Target

ALIAS or ANAME	<empty> or @	<ENVIRONMENT>-<PROJECT-ID>.<REGION>.platform.sh


In case you want to change an already added certificate, you will have to remove the domain and add it again with the new certificate.

Testing SSL
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a command line utility like curl to test that everything is configured correctly for your secure domain.

The -k option tells curl to ignore untrusted certificates.

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -kvI https://www.example.com
  About to connect() to www.example.com port 443 (#0)
  Trying 50.16.234.21... connected
  Connected to www.example.com (50.16.234.21) port 443 (#0)

  > Host: www.example.com
  > Accept: */*


Pay attention to the output. It should print SSL certificate verify ok. If it prints something like common name: www.example.com (does not match 'www.somedomain.com') then something is not configured correctly.

.. note::
  Platform.sh supports all kinds of certificates including domain-validated certificates, extended validation (EV) certificates, high-assurance certificates and wildcard certificates.
