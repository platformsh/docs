Install your Master site
========================

Once you've purchased a Platform package, you will be automatically redirected to your new Platform account. You can access your existing Platform accounts through your `Commerce Guys Marketplace account <https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/user>`_. Once you've logged in, click on the "Platforms" tab on your user account page. You will find a list of platform projects with links to each of them.

Install Kickstart / Drupal / Empty Git
--------------------------------------

  The first time you access the :ref:`ui_overview`, you'll see the project setup wizard which helps you to configure your project.

Choose a name for your project (this could be the domain of the site you are working on) and then choose a starting point:

* **Commerce Kickstart**: The quickest way to get up and running with Drupal Commerce.
* **Drupal 7**: Standard Drupal 7 installation profile.
* **From scratch**: Empty Git repository. Choose this option if you are migrating an existing site.

Once youâ€™re done, Platform will build your project and provide you a default :term:`environment` called :term:`Master`.

.. note::
   Choosing either 'Commerce Kickstart' or 'Drupal 7' will cause Platform to generate a :term:`make file` in the root of your repository. This :term:`make file` will be used to build your site.

First look at Platform
----------------------

  Once you've completed your project setup, you will be sent to your new project page. Now you can start working with Platform!

  1. **Project selection and configuration -** Switch between projects, or manage the configurations of the current project. Changing the project here will update everything below it to the current project.
  2. **Account administration, support, and documentation-** Use these quick access links to documentation resources, support options, or your current user account information.
  3. **Environment indicator, access information, and configuration-** This will tell you which environment (or branch) you are currently working in. The configuration icon and website link will apply specifically to this environment.
  4. **Git branch, synchronize, merge, and backups-** These primary actions are used for your regular development workflow for the specific environment. Read more about these actions in the :ref:`ui_overview` section.
  5. **Environment selector-** Switch between environment contexts. When you create a new branch by clicking the branch action link, those environemtns will appear here. Selecting an environment here will change everything to the right of this to that environment's context.
  6. **Environment activity stream-** Follow the latest activity for the current environment.
