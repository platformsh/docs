Install the Platform.sh software bundle
=======================================

`Platform.sh <https://platform.sh>`_  comes with a tool called the :ref:`cli`.

The :ref:`cli` is an open-source project hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. You can find help or raise issues for the CLI in the `GitHub issue queue <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/issues>`_.


Install Composer, the PHP dependency manager
--------------------------------------------

`Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ is a dependency manager for `PHP <http://php.net/>`_. 
For more details, see Composer's own installation instructions on their `getting started <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`_ page.  


Install Composer on OS X using Homebrew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open Terminal or a shell. 
Run these homebrew commands. ::

 brew update
 brew tap homebrew/dupes
 brew tap homebrew/php
 brew install composer


Install Composer on Linux 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the Composer .phar (PHP Archive). ::

 curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Check that the archive does something. ::

 php composer.phar

Move the archive to a command folder. ::

 sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
 sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer


Install Composer on Windows 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download and run `Composer-Setup.exe <https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe>`_.

It will install the latest Composer version and set up your PATH so that you can just call `composer` from any directory in your command line.

Open a terminal. 

Run composer. ::

 composer about


Install the Platform.sh CLI
---------------------------

This procedure installs the :ref:`cli` in the Composer's `.composer` folder. On OS X and Linux, this will be *~/.composer/vendor/bin/*.  

Install the :ref:`cli`::

  composer global require platformsh/cli:@stable

Add a path to the ``platform`` command ::

  echo 'export PATH="$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  source ~/.bash_profile

Find your Platform.sh login details (the e-mail address and password you use to authenticate to Marketplace).

Run the Platform.sh CLI for the first time. ::

  platform

You are then prompted for your Marketplace e-mail address and password.

Enter your details. A list of your projects appears, along with some tips for getting started. 

Your command line tools are now ready to use with Platform.sh.
