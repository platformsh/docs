User administration
===================

User roles
----------

Every Platform.sh user has a role. A role allows to control access and improve security on your project - different roles are authorized to do different things with your applications, environments and users. You can use your collection of Roles to manage how users interact with Platform.sh.

At the project level:

* **Project Administrator** - A project administrator can change settings and execute actions on any environment. 
* **Project Reader** - A project reader can view all environments within a project but cannot execute any actions on them.

A Project Reader can have a specific role on different environments. At the environment level:

* **Environment Administrator** - An environment administrator can change settings and execute actions on this environment. 
* **Environment Contributor** - An environment contributor can push code to this environment. He or she can also branch the environment. 
* **Environment Reader** - An environment reader can only view this environment.

When a development team works on a project, the team leader can be the project administrator and decide which roles to give his team members. One team member can contribute to one environment, another member can administer a different environment and the customer can be a reader of the ``master`` environment.

If you want your users to be able to see everything (Reader), but only commit to a specific branch, change their permission level on that environment to "Contributor".

.. note::
  The project owner - the person licensed to use Platform.sh - doesn't have special powers. A project owner usually has a project administrator role.

  | The ``Access control`` tab shows project-level users and their roles.
  |
  | Selecting a user will allow you either to edit that user's permissions or delete the user's access to the project entirely.
  |
  | Add a new user by clicking on the ``Add user`` button.
  |
  | If you select the 'Reader' role for the user, you'll have the option of adjusting the user's permissions at the environment level.

  | The ``User Management`` tab shows environment-level users and their roles.
  |
  | Selecting a user will allow you either to edit that user's permissions or delete the user's access to the environment entirely.
  |
  | Add a new user by clicking on the ``Add user`` button.

.. note::
  After a new user is added to the environment, it needs to be rebuilt (git push) for the changes to take effect. When the environment rebuild is complete, allow a minute for the routes to update fully and for the new user to be able to use SSH access.
