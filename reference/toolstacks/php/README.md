# PHP Toolstacks

Platform.sh supports any PHP application, in this section we provide information specific
to the configuration and operation of specific Frameworks and Toolstacks.

It is noteworthy that Platform.sh provids specific tooling to help you be more productive
(through built-in composer support or built-in drush support).

> **note**
> Find many examples for those configuration files on the [platformsh-examples repository on 
Github](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples).
> with many examples for Drupal, Symfony, Custom PHP Applications (with multi apps), Wordpress, Magento, Prestashop, Laravel...
Platform.sh supports custom PHP configurations.

## Configuring PHP

### PHP extensions

You can define the PHP extensions you want to enable or disable:

```yaml
# .platform.app.yaml
runtime:
    extensions:
        - http
        - redis
        - ssh2
    disabled_extensions:
        - sqlite3
```

The following extensions are enabled by default: *pdo, mysql, mysqli,
pdo_mysql, sqlite3, gd, curl, intl, mcrypt and zendopcache*. You can
disable those by adding them to the `disabled_extensions` list.

In addition, you can enable the following extensions: *apc, apcu,
blackfire, blackfire.psh-tmpl, enchant, gearman, geoip, gmp, http,
imagick, imap, ldap, memcache, memcached, mongo, pdo_pgsql,
pdo_sqlite, pgsql, pinba, pspell, recode, redis, snmp, spplus, ssh2,
tidy, xcache, xdebug, xhprof, xmlrpc and xsl*.

> **note**
> This list might not be fully up to date. For the complete list, check the output of `ls /etc/php5/mods-available` after you SSH into your environment.

### Use your own php.ini

You can also create and push a `php.ini` file that will be appended to
the configuration maintained by Platform.sh.

In your repository, the `php.ini` file should be added to the root of
the application (normally the repository root).

For example, if you need to increase the PHP memory limit:

```ini
; php.ini
; Increase PHP memory limit
memory_limit = 256M
```

After pushing your file, you can check that the custom PHP configuration
has been added to your environment by logging in via SSH and type:

```bash
web@kjh43kbobssae-master--php:~$ cat /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini

; =============== Custom configuration from `/app/php.ini`
; Increase PHP memory limit
memory_limit = 256M
```

> We do not limit what you can put in your `php.ini` file, but many
> settings can break your application. This is a facility for advanced
> users.
