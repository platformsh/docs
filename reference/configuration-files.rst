Configuration
=============

.. _application_configuration:

Configure your Application
--------------------------

The :term:`configuration files` are stored in Git and allow you to easily interact with Platform.sh. You can define and configure the services you want to deploy and use, the specific routes you need to serve your application...

You can find some examples for those configuration files on `Github <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples>`_.

Platform.sh exposes a ``.platform.app.yaml`` file which defines your :term:`application` and the way it will be built and deployed on Platform.sh.

.. code-block:: yaml

  # .platform.app.yaml
  # This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
  # in the same project.

  # The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
  name: php

  # The toolstack used to build the application.
  toolstack: "php:drupal"

  # The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
  # The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
  # to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
  # side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.
  relationships:
      database: "mysql:mysql"
      solr: "solr:solr"
      redis: "redis:redis"

  # The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
  web:
      # The public directory of the app, relative to its root.
      document_root: "/"
      # The front-controller script to send non-static requests to.
      passthru: "/index.php"

  # The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
  disk: 2048

  # The mounts that will be performed when the package is deployed.
  mounts:
      "/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"
      "/tmp": "shared:files/tmp"
      "/private": "shared:files/private"

  # The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.
  hooks:
      # We run deploy hook after your application has been deployed and started.
      deploy: "cd public ; drush -y updatedb"

  # The configuration of scheduled execution.
  crons:
      drupal:
          spec: "*/20 * * * *"
          cmd: "cd public ; drush core-cron"

.. note::
  The ``.platform.app.yaml`` is specific to your application. If you have multiple applications inside your Git repository, you need one ``.platform.app.yaml`` at the root of each application.

.. seealso::

  * `.platform.app.yaml default for Symfony <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/symfony/standard/.platform.app.yaml>`_
  * `.platform.app.yaml default for Drupal <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/drupal/7.x/.platform.app.yaml>`_

----

.. _name:

.. rubric:: Name

The ``name`` is the unique identifier of the :term:`application`. Platform.sh supports multiple applications within a project, so each application must have a **unique name** within a project.

----

.. _toolstack:

.. rubric:: Toolstack

The ``toolstack`` is used to build and run the project. It's in the form ``type[:subtype]``.

Possible values are:

* php:drupal
* php:symfony

----

.. _access:

.. rubric:: Access

The ``access`` define the user roles who can log in via SSH to the environments they have access to.

Possible values are:

* ssh: admin
* ssh: contributor
* ssh: viewer

----

.. _relationships:

.. rubric:: Relationships

The ``relationships`` defines how services are mapped within your :term:`application`.

The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed to the :term:`application` in the *PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS* environment variable. The right-hand side is in the form ``<service name>:<endpoint name>``.

Possible variables are:

* database: "mysql:mysql"
* solr: "solr:solr"
* redis: "redis:redis"

----

.. _web:

.. rubric:: Web

The ``web`` defines how the :term:`application` is exposed to the web (in HTTP).

It has a few sub-keys which are:

* **document_root**: The path relative to the root of the application that is exposed on the web. Typically ``/public`` or ``/web``.
* **passthru**:  The URL that is used in case of a 404 (*which is the equivalent of the rewrite rules in Drupal*). Typically ``/index.php`` or ``/app.php``.
* **whitelist**: A list of files (as regular expressions) that may be served.
* **expires**: The number of seconds whitelisted (static) content should be cached by the browswer. This enables the cache-control and expires headers for static content. The ``expires`` directive and resulting headers are left out entirely if this isn't set.

Contrary to standard ``.htaccess`` approaches, which accept a **blacklist** and allow everything to be accessed except a specific list, we accept a **whitelist** which means that anything not matched will trigger a 404 error and will be passed through to your ``passthru`` URL.

To extend the whitelist, you should copy the `default whitelist <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/symfony/todo-mvc-full/.platform.app.yaml#L23>`_, and only keep the extensions you need.

----

.. _disk:

.. rubric:: Disk

The ``disk`` defines the size of the persistent disk size of the :term:`application` in MB.

.. note::
  The minimal recommended disk size is 256MB. If you see the error **UserError: Error building the project: Disk size may not be smaller than 128MB**, increase the size to 256MB.

----

.. _mounts:

.. rubric:: Mounts

The ``mounts`` is an object whose keys are paths relative to the root of the application. It's in the form ``volume_id[/subpath]``.

For example with :term:`Drupal`, you'll want your ``sites/default/files`` to be mounted under a shared resource which is writable.

The format is:

* "/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"

.. note::
   The ``shared`` means that the volume is shared between your applications inside an environment. The ``disk`` key defines the size available for that ``shared`` volume.

----

.. _build_dependencies:

.. rubric:: Build dependencies

The ``dependencies`` allow you to specify dependencies that your application might need during the build process.

Platform.sh supports pulling any dependencies for the following languages:

* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* NodeJS

Those dependencies are independent of the eventual dependencies of your application, and are available in the ``PATH``, during the build process and in the runtime environment of your application.

You can specify those dependencies like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # .platform.app.yaml
  dependencies:
    php:
      drush/drush: "6.4.0"
    python:
      behave: "*"
    ruby:
      sass: "3.4.7"
    nodejs:
      grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"

----

.. _deployment_hooks:

.. rubric:: Hooks

The ``hooks`` (also called: :term:`deployment hooks`) let you define shell commands to run during the deployment process.

They can be executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application (build/deploy).

Possible hooks are:

* **build**: We run build hooks before your application has been packaged. No other services are accessible at this time since the application has not been deployed yet.
* **deploy**: We run deploy hooks after your application has been deployed and started. You can access other services at this stage (MySQL, Solr, Redis...).

Note that the "home" directory is `/app` while your application will be mounted in `/app/public` (by default, you can define this yourself in you .app.platform.yaml file)
so you might want to `cd /app/public` before running those.

After a Git push, you can see the results of the deployment hooks in the ``/var/log/deploy.log`` file when logging to the environment via SSH. It contains the log of the execution of the deployment hook. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    [2014-07-03 10:03:51.100476] Launching hook 'cd public ; drush -y updatedb'.

    My_custom_profile  7001  Update 7001: Enable the Platform module.
    Do you wish to run all pending updates? (y/n): y
    Performed update: my_custom_profile_update_7001
    'all' cache was cleared.
    Finished performing updates.

As a good example combining dependencies and hooks, you can compile your SASS files using Grunt.

In your ``.platform.app.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  dependencies:
    ruby:
      sass: "3.4.7"
    nodejs:
      grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"

  hooks:
    build: |
      cd public/profiles/project_name/themes/custom/theme_name
      npm install
      grunt

This requires the ``package.json`` and ``Gruntfile.js`` files to be correctly setup in the theme folder.

----

.. _crons:

.. rubric:: Crons

The ``crons`` is an object describing processes that are triggered on a schedule.

It has a few sub-keys which are:

* **spec**: The cron specification. For example:  ``*/20 * * * *``.
* **cmd**: The command that is executed, for example `cd public ; drush core-cron``

.. _services_configuration:

Configure Services
------------------

Platform.sh allows you to completely define and configure the topology and services you want to use on your project.

The topology is stored into a ``services.yaml`` file which should be added inside the ``.platform`` folder at the root of your Git repository.

If you don't have a ``.platform`` folder, you need to create one:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir .platform

Here is an example of a ``services.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # .platform/services.yaml
  mysql:
    type: mysql
    disk: 2048

  solr:
    type: solr
    disk: 1024

.. rubric:: Available services

* mysql
* solr
* redis

.. seealso::

  * `services.yaml for Symfony <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/symfony/standard-full/.platform/services.yaml>`_
  * `services.yaml for Drupal <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/drupal/7.x/.platform/services.yaml>`_

.. _routes_configuration:

Configure Routes
----------------

Platform.sh allows you to define the routes that will serve your environments.

A route describes how an incoming URL is going to be processed by Platform.sh.
The routes are stored into a ``routes.yaml`` file which should be added inside the ``.platform`` folder at the root of your Git repository.

If you don't have a ``.platform`` folder, you need to create one:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir .platform

Here is an example of a ``routes.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # .platform/routes.yaml
  "http://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "php:php"
  "http://www.{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "http://{default}/"

.. seealso::

  * `routes.yaml for Symfony <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/symfony/standard-full/.platform/routes.yaml>`_
  * `routes.yaml for Drupal <https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/drupal/7.x/.platform/routes.yaml>`_

Sending emails
----------------

By default only the master enviroment can send emails and there is no need to additionally configure your web application to enable that. For the non-master environment this feature can be enabled by using the Platform CLI.

For example, in case you want to enable sending emails for your non-master environment use this command:

.. code-block:: console

  platform environment:metadata enable_smtp true

Emails from Platform.sh are sent via a Mandrill-based SMTP proxy. Each Platform.sh project is provisioned as a Mandrill sub-account.

.. note::
  Mandrill subaccounts are capped at 12k emails per month.
