Changes in version 1.7.0
------------------------

Version 1.7.0, deployed on September 4th, 2014, introduces changes in the
configuration files format. Most of the old configuration format is still
supported, but customers are invited to move to the new format.

For an example upgrade path, see the `Drupal 7.x branch of the Platformsh-examples repository 
<https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples/blob/drupal/7.x/.platform.app.yaml>`_
on Github.

Configuration items for PHP that previously was part of ``.platform/services.yaml``
are now moved into ``.platform.app.yaml``, which gains the following top-level
items:

* ``name``: should be ``"php"``
* ``relationships``, ``access`` and ``disk``: should be the same as the ``relationships`` key of PHP in
  ``.platform/services.yaml``

Note that there is now a sane default for ``access`` (SSH access to PHP is granted
to all users that have role "collaborator" and above on the environment) so most
customers can now just omit this key in ``.platform.app.yaml``.

In addition, version 1.7.0 now has consistency checks for configuration files
and will reject ``git push`` operations that contain configuration files that
are invalid. In this case, just fix the issues as they are reported, commit
and push again.
