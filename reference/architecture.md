# Architecture

The Environments  in [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh)
rely on services. Services are deployed inside highly
restricted containers on a grid of servers. Monitoring and
fail-over happen automatically, behind the scene.

Services are grouped together in *virtual clusters*, and
dynamically keep track of each other.

> **note**
> Platform.sh currently supports the following services: PHP, MySQL (MariaDB), Solr, Redis, Postgres, MongoDB. Additional services will be available soon.

## Micro container

Platform.sh uses LXC containers for applications. Each container
provides a secure space to run one application. Each environment is
built from many containers - one for the router, another for the PHP
service, a third for the database and so on.

## Router service

Based on nginx, the Router service processes HTTP requests, handles
security, dynamic page construction (ESI), URL rewriting and mapping.

## PHP service

Supports PHP 5.4, the APC and ZO+ opcode caches, and all major PHP
extensions, rewriting, and mapping.

## Database service (MariaDB)

Transactional data storage. Based on MariaDB, supporting the XtraDB
storage engine (equivalent to MySQL with InnoDB).

-   **host:** database.internal
-   **port:** 3306
-   **username:** [blank]
-   **password:** [blank]

Access to MariaDB is only possible from the PHP-FPM containers, thus
username/password based authentication is not used.

To access the MariaDB database directly, ssh into the web server and use
the following command: `mysql -h database.internal`

You can also use Drush: `drush sql-cli`

## File system

Accessible transparently from PHP and mappable to a URL space by the
Router component.

## Search Service (Solr)

Solr search with generic schemas provided.

-   **host:** solr.internal
-   **scheme:** solr
-   **port:** 8080

## Object cache (Redis)

Provides the in-memory object cache for your application. Can be used as
a cache area for your application.

-   **host:** redis.internal
-   **scheme:** redis
-   **port:** 6379
