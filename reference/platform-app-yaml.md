# `.platform.app.yaml`

## Configure your Application

You control your application and the way it will be built and deployed on Platform.sh
via a single configuration file `.platform.app.yaml` located at the root of your application 
folder inside your Git repository.

Here is an example of a `.platform.app.yaml` file for Drupal:

    # The unique identifier of the application.
    name: front
    # The language that will run your application.
    type: php:5.5
    # The way to build your application.
    build:
        flavor: drupal
    # The way services are mapped within your application.
    relationships:
        database: "mysql:mysql"
        solr: "solr:solr"
        redis: "redis:redis"
    # The way your application is exposed to the web.
    web:
        locations:
            "/":
                root: "public"
                expires: -1
                passthru: "/index.php"
                index: 
                    - index.php
                allow: true
    # The size of the persistent disk size of your application in MB.
    disk: 2048
    # The volumes that are mounted under a writable shared resource.
    mounts:
        "/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"
        "/tmp": "shared:files/tmp"
        "/private": "shared:files/private"
    # The shell commands to run during the build or deployment process.
    hooks:
        # We run deploy hook after your application has been deployed and started.
        deploy: |
            cd public
            drush -y updatedb
    # The processes that are triggered on a schedule.
    crons:
        drupal:
            spec: "*/20 * * * *"
            cmd: "cd public ; drush core-cron"

> **Note**
> This configuration file is specific to one application. If you have multiple
> applications inside your Git repository (i.e. a RESTful
> web service and a front-end, or a main web site and a blog), you need 
> one `.platform.app.yaml` at the root of each application 
> [see here](/platform-app-yaml-multi-app.html).  

### Name

The `name` is the unique identifier of the application. Platform.sh
supports multiple applications within a project, so each application
must have a **unique name** within a project. The name may only be
composed of lower case alpha-numeric characters. (a-z0-9).

This name is used in the `.platform/routes.yaml` file to define the HTTP upstream
(by default `php:php` - if you called your application `app` you will
need to use `app:php` in the upstream field).

You can also use this name in multi-application relationships.

> **Note**
> Changing the name of an app is the same as deleting it and replacing
> it: your app data (static files) will be deleted.
>
> If you change the name you should think about updating your other
> configuration files: `.platform/routes.yaml` and any other
> `.platform.app.yaml` files you have in a multi-application project.

### Type

The `type` defines what language will run your application.

The `type` can be:

* `php`
* `nodejs`
* `hhvm`

**Example**

    type: php:5.6

### Build

The `build` defines what will happen by default when building the application. 

It has a sub property `flavor` for which the possible values are:

* `drupal` means that `drush make` will automatically run if you provide `.make` files.
* `composer` means that `composer install` will automatically run if you provide a `composer.json` or `composer.lock` file.
* `symfony` is an alisas for `composer`.

**Example**

    build:
        flavor: symfony

### Access

The `access` define the user roles who can log in via SSH to the
environments they have access to.

Possible values are:

* ssh: admin
* ssh: contributor
* ssh: viewer

### Relationships

The `relationships` defines how services are mapped within your
application.

The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
to the application in the *PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS* environment
variable. The right-hand side is in the form
`<service name>:<endpoint name>`. where "service name" comes from the
 `.platform/services.yaml` and  "endpoint name" should be the same as the
 value of "type"  declared in that same file.

> **Note**
> In the first  example above you could very well have something
> like `mycache: "arediscache:redis"` instead of `redis: "redis:redis"` (if in
> `services.yaml` you named your a service of type `redis` with `arediscache`.
> more often than not in our example we simply call a redis service "redis" a
> mysql one "mysql" etc..

*Example*

    relationships:
        database: "mysql:mysql"
        database2: "mysql2:mysql"
        cache: "arediscache:redis"
        search: "searchengine:solr"

> **Note**
> Read the [`services.yaml` documentation](reference/services-yaml.html)
> for a full list of currently supported service types and service endpoints.

### Web

The `web` key defines how the application is exposed to the web (in HTTP). Here we tell the web application how to serve content, including static files, front-controller scripts, index files, index scripts, and so on. We support any directory structure, so the static files can be in a subdirectory, and the `index.php` file can be further down.

It has the following subkeys:

#### Commands

The `commands` key defines the command to launch the application.

It has a few subkeys which are:

* `start`: The command line to use to launch the application. Can be a string, or *null* if the application is only made of static files. It's filled out during the build process for PHP.

*Example*

    web:
        commands:
            start: "uwsgi --ini conf/server.ini"

#### Locations

The `locations` key allows you to provide specific parameters for different URL prefixes.

*Example*

    web:
        locations:
            "/":
                ...
            "/sites/default/files":
                ...

It has a few subkeys which are:

* `root`: The folder to serve static assets for this location from relative to the application root. Typically `public` or `web`.
* `passthru`: Whether to forward disallowed and missing resources from this location to the application. Can be true, false or a URI path string. Typically your applications front controller `/index.php` or `/app.php`.
* `index`: The file or files to consider when serving a request for a directory. Can be file name, and array of file names or *null*. Typically `index.html`. Note that in order for this to work, the static file(s) should be allowed by your rules. For example, to use a file named `index.html` as an index file, your rules must allow elements that matches the filename, like `- \.html$`.
* `expires`: How long to allow static assets from this location to be cached (this enables the cache-control and expires headers). Can be a time or *-1* for no caching. Times can be suffixed with "ms" (milliseconds), "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "w" (weeks), "M" (months, 30d) or "y" (years, 365d). The `expires` directive and resulting headers are left out entirely if this isn't set.
* `scripts`: Whether to allow loading scripts in that location (*true* or *false*).
* `allow`: Whether to allow serving files which don't match a rule (*true* or *false*, default: *true*).
* `rules`: Specific overrides for a specific location. The key is a PCRE regular expression that is matched against the full request path. Here is a list of example regular expressions that you could provide rules for: *\\.css$,\\.js$,\\.gif$,\\.jpe?g$,\\.png$,\\.tiff?$,\\.wbmp$,\\.ico$,\\.jng$,\\.bmp$,\\.svgz?$,\\.midi?$,\\.mpe?ga$,\\.mp2$,\\.mp3$,\\.m4a$,\\.ra$,\\.weba$,\\.3gpp?$,\\.mp4$,\\.mpe?g$,\\.mpe$,\\.ogv$,\\.mov$,\\.webm$,\\.flv$,\\.mng$,\\.asx$,\\.asf$,\\.wmv$,\\.avi$,\\.ogx$,\\.swf$,\\.jar$,\\.ttf$,\\.eot$,\\.woff$,\\.otf$,/robots\\.txt$*.

*Example*

    web:
        locations:
            "/":
                root: "public"
                passthru: "/index.php"
                index: 
                    - index.php
                expires: -1
                scripts: true
                allow: true
                rules:
                    \.mp4$:
                        allow: false
                        expires: -1
            "/sites/default/files":
                expires: 300
                passthru: true
                allow: true

### Disk

The `disk` defines the size of the persistent disk size of the
application in MB.

> **Note**
> The minimal recommended disk size is 256MB. If you see the error `UserError: Error building the project: Disk size may not be smaller than 128MB`, increase the size to 256MB.


### Mounts

The `mounts` is an object whose keys are paths relative to the root of
the application. It's in the form `volume_id[/subpath]`.

For example with Drupal, you'll want your `sites/default/files` to be
mounted under a shared resource which is writable.

The format is:

* `"/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"`

> **Note**
> The `shared` means that the volume is shared between your applications inside an environment. The `disk` key defines the size available for that `shared` volume.


### Build dependencies

The `dependencies` allow you to specify dependencies that your
application might need during the build process.

Platform.sh supports pulling any dependencies for the following
languages:

* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* NodeJS
* Java (with integrated Maven and Ant support)

Those dependencies are independent of the eventual dependencies of your
application, and are available in the `PATH`, during the build process
and in the runtime environment of your application.

You can specify those dependencies like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  php:
    drush/drush: "6.4.0"
  python:
    behave: "*"
  ruby:
    sass: "3.4.7"
  nodejs:
    grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"
```


### Hooks

The `hooks` (also called: deployment hooks) let you define shell
commands to run during the deployment process.

They can be executed at various points in the lifecycle of the
application (build/deploy).

Possible hooks are:

-   **build**: We run build hooks before your application has been
    packaged. No other services are accessible at this time since the
    application has not been deployed yet.
-   **deploy**: We run deploy hooks after your application has been
    deployed and started. You can access other services at this stage
    (MySQL, Solr, Redis...).

> **Note**
> The "home" directory is /app while your application will be
mounted in /app/public (by default, you can define this yourself in you
.app.platform.yaml file) so you might want to cd /app/public before
running those.

The hooks will be considered failed if the final command in them fails. To
cause them to fail on the first failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning
of the hook.

After a Git push, you can see the results of the `deploy` hook in the
`/var/log/deploy.log` file when logging to the environment via SSH. It
contains the log of the execution of the deployment hook. For example:

```bash
[2014-07-03 10:03:51.100476] Launching hook 'cd public ; drush -y updatedb'.

My_custom_profile  7001  Update 7001: Enable the Platform module.
Do you wish to run all pending updates? (y/n): y
Performed update: my_custom_profile_update_7001
'all' cache was cleared.
Finished performing updates.
```

#### [Example] Compile SASS files using Grunt

As a good example combining dependencies and hooks, you can compile your
SASS files using Grunt.

In your `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ruby:
    sass: "3.4.7"
  nodejs:
    grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"

hooks:
  build: |
    cd public/profiles/project_name/themes/custom/theme_name
    npm install
    grunt
```

This requires the `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js` files to be
correctly setup in the theme folder.

#### [Example] Trigger deploy hook on a specific environment

To trigger a deploy hook only on a specific environment, use the following
environment variable: `$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT` that you put in a `if/then` statement.

In your `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```
hooks:
  deploy: |
    if [ $PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT = "master" ]; then
      # Use Drush to disable the Devel module on the Master environment.
      drush dis devel -y
    else
      # Use Drush to enable the Devel module on other environments.
      drush en devel -y
    fi
```

### Crons / Cronjobs

The `crons` is an object describing processes that are triggered on a
schedule.

It has a few subkeys which are:

-   **spec**: The cron specification. For example: `*/20 * * * *`.
-   **cmd**: The command that is executed, for example
    cd public ; drush core-cron\`

The minimum interval between cron runs is 5 minutes, even if specified as less.

## Default configuration file

if you do not have a `.platform.app.yaml` file the following one that assumes you are deploying a Drupal instance will be applied:

```yaml
name: php
type: php:5.4
build:
    flavor: drupal
access:
    ssh: contributor
relationships:
    database: "mysql:mysql"
    solr: "solr:solr"
    redis: "redis:redis"
web:
    document_root: "/"
    passthru: "/index.php"
disk: 2048
mounts:
    "/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"
    "/tmp": "shared:files/tmp"
    "/private": "shared:files/private"
crons:
    drupal:
        spec: "*/20 * * * *"
        cmd: "cd public ; drush core-cron"
```

* [Past Changes of the configuration format can be found here](reference/upgrade/)
