Environment variables
=====================

Platform.sh exposes :term:`environment variables` which you can interact with.

When you're logged in via SSH to an environment, you can list the environment variables by running:

.. code-block:: console

	web@kjh43kbobssae-master--php:~$ export

Since they are **base64-encoded JSON object** that maps variable names to variable values, you can decode the value of a specific variable by running:

.. code-block:: console

	web@kjh43kbobssae-master--php:~$ php5 -r 'print_r(json_decode(base64_decode(getenv("PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS"))));'

	stdClass Object
	(
	    [solr] => Array
	        (
	            [0] => stdClass Object
	                (
	                    [ip] => 250.0.80.135
	                    [host] => solr.internal
	                    [scheme] => solr
	                    [port] => 8080
	                )
	        )
	    [database] => Array
	        (
	            [0] => stdClass Object
	                (
	                    [username] =>
	                    [password] =>
	                    [ip] => 250.0.80.112
	                    [host] => database.internal
	                    [query] => stdClass Object
	                        (
	                            [is_master] => 1
	                        )

	                    [path] => main
	                    [scheme] => mysql
	                    [port] => 3306
	                )
	        )
	)

.. note::
	Variables are **hierarchical**, so if a variable is not overriden in an environment, it will take the value it has in the parent environment and use it as ``inherited``.
	This allows you to define your development variables only once, and use them on all the children environments.

Platform.sh variables
---------------------

:term:`Environment variables` that are specific to Platform.sh are exposed in the runtime (*ie. PHP*) and prefixed with ``PLATFORM_*``.

* **PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS**: A base64-encoded JSON object whose keys are the relationship name and the values are arrays of relationship endpoint definitions. Each relationship endpoint definition is a decomposed form of a URL. It has a ``scheme``, a ``host``, a ``port``, and optionally a ``username``, ``password``, ``path`` and some additional information in ``query``.
* **PLATFORM_ROUTES**: Describe the routes that you defined in the environment. It maps the content of the ``.platform/routes.yaml`` file.
* **PLATFORM_PROJECT**: The ID of the project.
* **PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT**: The name of the environment (*ie. the name of the branch in Git*).
* **PLATFORM_TREE_ID**: The ID of the tree the application was built from. It's essentially the SHA of the tree in Git.
* **PLATFORM_VARIABLES**: A base64-encoded JSON object which keys are variables names and values are variable values (*a string*).
* **PLATFORM_APPLICATION**: A base64-encoded JSON object that describes the application. It maps the content of the ``.platform.app.yaml`` that you have in Git and it has a few subkeys.

Since values can change over time, the best thing is to just introspect the variable at runtime and use it to configure your application.

For example with Drupal, we use the **PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS** variable to configure your ``settings.local.php``.

Toolstack-specific variables
----------------------------

You can define variables based on the :term:`toolstack` you're working with.

For example with Drupal, you would prefix your :term:`Environment variables` with ``drupal:``. Those variables will then be special-cased by our ``settings.local.php`` and directly added to ``$conf``.

An example variable:

* ``drupal:site_name`` which will directly set the site name of your Drupal site on an environment.
