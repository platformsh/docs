To specify a Java container, use the `type` property in your `.platform.app.yaml`.

## Support libraries

While it is possible to read the environment directly from your application, it is generally easier and more robust to use the [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java) which handles decoding of service credential information for you.

## Support build automation

Platform.sh supports the most common project management tools in the Java ecosystem, including:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)


## Accessing services

To access various [services](/configuration/services.html) with Java, see the following examples.  The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.

## Project templates

A number of project templates for major Java applications are available on GitHub. Not all of them are proactively maintained but all can be used as a starting point or reference for building your own website or web application.
