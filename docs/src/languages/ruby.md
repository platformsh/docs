  Platform.sh supports deploying any Ruby application. Your application can use any Ruby application server such as Unicorn or Puma and deploying a Rails or a Sinatra app is very straight forward.

## Unicorn based Rails configuration

In this example, we use Unicorn to run our Ruby application. You could use any Ruby application server such as Puma or Thin.

Configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings as listed below, a complete example is included at the end of this section.

1. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):

    {{< readFile file="/registry/images/examples/full/ruby.app.yaml" highlight="yaml" >}}

2. Build your application with the build hook.

    Assuming you have your  dependencies stored in the `Gemfile` at the root of your application folder to execute build steps:

    ```yaml
    hooks:
      build: bundle install --without development test
      deploy: RACK_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate
    ```

    These are installed as your project dependencies in your environment. You can also use the `dependencies` key to install global dependencies theses can be Ruby, Python, NodeJS or PHP libraries.

3. Configure the command you use to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section, e.g.:

    ```yaml
    web:
        upstream:
            socket_family: unix
        commands:
            start: "unicorn -l $SOCKET -E production config.ru"
    ```

    This assumes you have Unicorn as a dependency in your Gemfile

     ```ruby
    # Use Unicorn as the app server
    group :production do
      gem 'unicorn'
    end
    ```

    and that you have a rackup file `config.ru` at the root of your repository, for example for a rails application you would put:

    ```ruby
    require "rubygems"
    require ::File.expand_path('../config/environment', __FILE__)
    run Rails.application
    ```

4. Define the web locations your application is using:

    ```yaml
    web:
       locations:
           "/":
               root: "public"
               passthru: true
               expires: 1h
               allow: true
    ```

    This configuration asks our web server to handle HTTP requests at "/static" to serve static files stored in `/app/static/` folder while everything else are forwarded to your application server.

5. Create any Read/Write mounts. The root file system is read only. You must explicitly describe writable mounts.

    ```yaml
    mounts:
        tmp:
            source: local
            source_path: tmp
        logs:
            source: local
            source_path: logs
    ```

    This setting allows your application writing files to `/app/tmp` and have logs stored in `/app/logs`.

    You can define other read/write mounts (your application code itself being deployed to a read-only file system). Note that the file system is persistent, and when you backup your cluster these mounts get backed-up too.

6. Then, setup the routes to your application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    "https://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        # the first part should be your project name
        upstream: "app:http"
    ```

    Here is the complete `.platform.app.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    name: 'app'
    type: "ruby:2.6"

    web:
        upstream:
            socket_family: unix
        commands:
            start: "unicorn -l $SOCKET -E production config.ru"

        locations:
            "/":
                root: "public"
                passthru: true
                expires: 1h
                allow: true

    relationships:
        database: "database:mysql"

    disk: 2048

    hooks:
      build: bundle install --without development test
      deploy: RACK_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate

    mounts:
        tmp:
            source: local
            source_path: tmp
        logs:
            source: local
            source_path: logs
    ```

## Configuring services

7. In this example we assue in the `relationships` key that we have a mysql instance. To configure it we need to create a `.platform/services.yaml` with for eample:

    ```yaml
    database:
      type: mysql:10.4
      disk: 2048
    ```

## Connecting to services

You can [define services](/configuration/services.md) in your environment. And, link to the services using `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml
relationships:
    database: "mysqldb:mysql"
```

By using the following ruby function calls, you can obtain the database details.

```ruby
require "base64"
require "json"
relationships= JSON.parse(Base64.decode64(ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']))
```

Which should give you something like:

```json
{
   "database" : [
      {
         "path" : "main",
         "query" : {
            "is_master" : true
         },
         "port" : 3306,
         "username" : "user",
         "password" : "",
         "host" : "database.internal",
         "ip" : "246.0.241.50",
         "scheme" : "mysql"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Project templates

A number of project templates for Ruby applications and typical configurations are available on GitHub.  Not all of them are proactively maintained but all can be used as a starting point or reference for building your own website or web application.

Platform.sh also provides a [helper library](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-ruby-helper) for Ruby applications that simplifies presenting environment information to your application.  It is not required to run Ruby applications on Platform.sh but is recommended.
