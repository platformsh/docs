If you have already [pushed your code]({{< relref "/gettingstarted/introduction/own-code/_index.md" >}}) to Platform.sh, then you should already have a local repository that you can build from.

Otherwise, it will be necessary to download a local copy of your project first.

1. **Get project ID**

    You will need the your *project ID*. You can retrieve this ID at any time using the CLI commands `platform` or `platform project:list`.

2. **Get a copy of the repository locally**

    Next, use the CLI to download the code in your Platform.sh project using the command

    ```bash
    platform get <project id>
    ```

Now that you have a local copy of your application that is configured to the Platform.sh remote repository, you can create a new .
