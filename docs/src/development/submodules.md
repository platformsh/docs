## Clone submodules during deployment

Platform.sh allows you to use submodules in your Git repository. They are usually listed in a `.gitmodules` file at the root of your Git repository. When you push via Git, Platform.sh will try to clone them automatically.

Here is an example of a ``.gitmodules`` file:

```ini
[submodule "app/Oro"]
	path = src/Oro
	url = https://github.com/orocrm/platform.git
[submodule "src/OroPackages/src/Oro/Bundle/EntitySerializedFieldsBundle"]
	path = src/OroPackages/src/Oro/Bundle/EntitySerializedFieldsBundle
	url = https://github.com/orocrm/OroEntitySerializedFieldsBundle.git
[submodule "src/OroB2B"]
	path = src/OroB2B
	url = https://github.com/orocommerce/orocommerce.git
```

When you run ``git push``, you can see the output of the log:

```bash
Validating submodules.
  Updated submodule git://github.com/orocommerce/orocommerce: 4 references updated.
  Updated submodule git://github.com/orocrm/platform: 229 references updated.
  Updated submodule git://github.com/orocrm/OroEntitySerializedFieldsBundle: 11 references updated.
```

## Error when validating submodules

If you see the following error:

```bash
Validating submodules.
  Found unresolvable links, updating submodules.

E: Error validating submodules in tree:
    - /src/Oro: Exception: commit 03567c6 not found.

   This might be due to the following errors fetching submodules:
    - git@github.com:orocommerce/orocommerce.git: HangupException: The remote server unexpectedly closed the connection.
```

Since the Platform.sh Git server cannot connect to Github via SSH without being granted an SSH key to do so, you should not be using an SSH URL: ``git@github.com:...``, but you should use an HTTPS URL instead: ``https://github.com/...``.

## Use of private git repositories

When using Git submodules that are hosted on private repositories, using the `https` protocol will fail with errors like:

```bash
GitProtocolError: unexpected http resp 401 for https://bitbucket.org/myusername/mymodule.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
```

To fix this, you need to:

1. Change your `.gitmodules` file from the HTTPS syntax to the SSH syntax, e.g.

    from:

    ```bash
    [submodule "support/mymodule"]
        path = support/mymodule
        url = https://bitbucket.org/myusername/mymodule.git
    ```

    to:

    ```bash
    [submodule "support/mymodule"]
        path = support/mymodule
        url=git@bitbucket.org:myusername/mymodule.git
    ```

2. Add the SSH public key in the Platform.sh project settings "Deploy Key" tab in the Web UI as per the [Private Repository](/development/private-repository.md) documentation page, which will allow our Git service to pull the module from the remote git service. This assumes you have configured the remote git repository to allow this by generating a private/public key pair. For example, see the [Bitbucket documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-ssh-keys-in-bitbucket-pipelines-847452940.html).
