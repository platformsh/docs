# Install your infrastructure dependencies:

This guide will not teach you how to set up local development environment there
are a billion blogs for that.. Anyway, to work with Platform.sh. You basically 
just need a web server.. unless your application needs a database a search 
engine or the such. If you want to run the project locally, which is not 
required... follow the following links, and follow their installation 
guides.

-   [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) (or Apache) web server
-   Optional: [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (or MySQL) database
-   Optional: [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/),
    Optional: [Redis](http://redis.io/)

Platform.sh is currently running PHP 5.4, MySQL Ver 15.1 Distrib
5.5.40-MariaDB <!-- FIXME VERIFY VERSIONS !-->
