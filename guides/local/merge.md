# Time for Production

You can now test your change. You like it? Want to put it into production?
![Platform Web Merge](/images/platform-web-merge.png)
Click on the merge button a voilÃ ! it is going to redeploy your production

You can also do this from the command line.. with nothing but git..
```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

   f56715e..2548c67  master -> master
```

Visually of course nothing will change.. we synchronize the code.. not the 
database (that would be stupid). So you will need to reactivate the theme. In
real life you would probably export a feature or do this in an installation
profile. 

And you can always `platform checkout master; platform drush vset theme_default bootstrap`
from the command line to the same effect...
