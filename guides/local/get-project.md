# Use the Platform.sh CLI to obtain and build your projectâ€™s repository
Convientiently on the Web Interface we give you the command you can copy and
paste into your terminal.

So lets `cd` to wherever you put your sites (for example ~/htdocs or ~/Sites).

![Platform Web Ui Platform Cli Get](/images/platform-web-ui-platform-cli-get.png)

And paste the command to our terminal:
```
$ platform get vmwklzcpbi6zq a-drupal-site-for-the-masses --environment master
Created project directory: a-drupal-site-for-the-masses
  Cloning into 'a-drupal-site-for-the-masses/repository'...

The Platform CLI downloaded your project and built it. If now we cd to the
directory, in our case `cd a-drupal-site-for-the-masses`, we will see three 
directories.
