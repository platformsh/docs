# Push your codebase via Git

When Git is ready on your project, simply push your local branch to your Platform.sh remote.

```bash
$ git push platform HEAD:master
```

Both on the terminal and on the Platform.sh Web Interface, you should see your Master
environment being built.

> **note**
> Depending on your Git remote, the push command might change from platform to origin.
