#Understand Build Modes

Platform.sh offers three build modes for Drupal projects: Traditional, Drush
Make, and Install Profiles.

> **note**

> You can change build modes by changing the files in your repository.
> Platform.sh recognizes each mode based on the presence or absence of
> `project.make` or `*.profile` files.
