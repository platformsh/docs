# Now we have a new environment
We'll get into this in a bit more detail later.. but the best way currently
to develop Drupal sites is with Drush Make Files. We'll show you how cool this
is.

type `platform` again in your projects directory. 

You should see the new branch that was created, and a couple of starting points
to help you get along.

```
$ platform
