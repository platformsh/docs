# Getting Started with Drupal

Platform.sh has unparalleled Drupal support (it was created by Commerce Guys
 after all!).

We encapsulate as much as possible working with Drupal applying best-practices 
... which basically means using a Drush make file and exporting features. Doing 
this carries great many benefits we will not go into now.. it keeps your code 
base small, you get everything updated automatically, its both faster and 
safer and makes unicorns dance.

But we also allow for other styles: you can develop and deploy using 
installation profiles.. or by simply committing the whole code tree with core 
and contrib modules (what we call "Vanilla Drupal" or the traditional way of 
doing things).

For your information Platform.sh supports any Drupal version. 
 
Let's dive in.
