# Going deeper

That was fun right? In a few minutes we were able to create a new website, 
create a brand new staging server for it.. just for a single feature.. change 
the theme and be in production. This is why Platform.sh is great and it works
great with the build oriented approach of Drush Make Files. 

But that's not the only way to work with Platform.sh or with Drupal...

In this section we are going to get to just a bit more detail about how to have
a local development environment that works great in a Platform.sh workflow.. and
how  Platform.sh handles the different way you might want to work on a Drupal 
project (committing the whole tree, using and installation .. or using Drush 
Make).
