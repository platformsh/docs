# Let's Activate the theme.
You can now visit the new environment (you have the url in the Web Interface,
or you type `platform url` on the command line and it will open your default
browser). And activate the theme in the administration interface of Drupal.

If you have Drush installed you could very simply activate the theme by typing
`platform drush vset theme_default bootstrap` (this command will execute drush
on the remote environment).
