# Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP, it helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of PHP projects, ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.

See https://getcomposer.org/ for more information and documentation. Composer will help you not only easily 
install the Platform.sh CLI (command line interface) but also make sure it stays up-to-date.

We are giving you here some basic steps on how to install it, for more details, see Composer's own installation instructions on their [getting started](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) page.
