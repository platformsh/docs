# Configuring Platform.sh

Platform.sh also gives you very fine grained control over its components (what database you want to use, how mush disk would you like to allocate to each one? A custom PHP.INI file.. or the configuration of your caching).

This guide will help you get started, its not a complete reference, [which you can find here](http://docs.platform.sh). It only covers the basic setup of the required tools, and the steps needed to deploy a simple application. Platform.sh can do much more.

Additionally, there are [example repositories available](https://github.com/platformsh?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=example) with example configurations:

[Drupal 7](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal7)
[Drupal 7 Commerce](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupalcommerce7)
[Drupal 8](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8)
