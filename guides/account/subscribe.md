# Getting a Platform.sh account

Platform.sh is a hosted service, in order to use it you first need an account, either:

1. Got to the [Get a Platform](https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/platform/buy-now) page and follow the checkout process.
2. Or if you have a Bitbucket Account, login to bitbucket and visit the [add on directory](http://bitbucket.org/account/addon-directory/) filter the list for "deployment" and choose the Platform.sh add-on, an account will be generated for you automatically.

Note that we currently offer a free trial period to let you play, and fall in love with Platform.sh

Now the important thing is to get your public ssh key uploaded to your Platform.sh account.
