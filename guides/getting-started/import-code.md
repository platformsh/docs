# Import your codebase

For the purposes of this tutorial, it is presumed that your Drupal codebase is in the "public" directory of your repository. Note that putting your Drupal webroot at the root of the repository is not supported.

This screen tells you that you need to push your codebase to Platform.sh.

This is done by either adding the ``platform`` remote to your existing Git repository, or initialize Git in your repository and push your codebase to Platform.sh.
