## Base nav

Navigation available in Bootstrap share general markup and styles, from the base `.nav` class to the active and disabled states. Swap modifier classes to switch between each style.

The base `.nav` component is built with flexbox and provide a strong foundation for building all types of navigation components. It includes some style overrides (for working with lists), some link padding for larger hit areas and basic disabled styling.

{{< callout theme="info" >}}
##### Note

The base `.nav` component does not include any `.active` state. The following examples include the class, mainly to demonstrate that this particular class does not trigger any special styling.
{{< /callout >}}
